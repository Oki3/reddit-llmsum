    "input": "Have you done in-depth research about doing a local high school? It seems preposterous that it would take you 3 additional years to finish high school when you have (I assume) already completed 3 years. There might be some small requirement differences, but I would be shocked if it took more than 1 year over your normal grad date to complete the requirements. I know this part won't be easy to hear, but you're not depressed because you're apart from your BF. You might be sad. He might be sad. Neither of you are depressed. You are young people in \"love\" and you will be sad while you are apart. Nothing will change that, but there is nothing wrong with you in a clinical psychological sense because of this. If you feel the need to write bad poetry, do so (just please don't submit it here). But you will be fine after a few years cool off your teenage genitals.",
    "reference": "Calm the tits down. You will be fine. Ideally work for a diploma, but a GED is ok in many circumstances. You're not depressed, you're just a teenager.",
    "prediction": "Post: Advice on dealing with sadness after breaking up with a partner. The poster has completed 3 years of high school and wants to know if it would take an additional 3 years to finish the remaining requirements. The post argues that it is normal to feel sad during a breakup, but there is nothing wrong with the individual's mental health. The post advises the reader to write poetry if they feel the need to express their emotions, but suggests that they will be fine after a few years of emotional recovery."
