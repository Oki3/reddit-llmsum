Either way, i have no sources other than the random rave kids I talked to about dNb when i was a teenager around 98. I concluded that it was ultimately stupid to try to differentiate between the terms Jungle and Drum and Bass, because usually if you asked people the difference they either wouldn't give you a real answer, or it would be so specific that it seems they would be naming specific songs rather than groupings of stylings. I have also been told that british people, tend to use the word Jungle while American's drum and bass; however, I kinda know this is bullshit because I hear Pete Tong on Essential Mixes time and time again use the term drum and bass as well as other DJs I have met in person (London Elektricty, Goldie)",

I'm having a hard time trying to describe what I'm thinking, so here's an example/hypothetical situation: Pretend the FA pitcher batch is over and everyone is signed. We then find out, that IRL, CC Sabathia got his left arm cut off. If this proposed rule is upheld, I would lose Sabathia, and then I have missed out on the premiere FA pitching batch, putting my team in a really crappy situation. Another example: Pretend we got word that A-Rod was hurt, but after the final FA batch. I then would be completely screwed out of a solid 3B without the chance to sign another.",

But, the limit on how well you can see those scenes is the static contrast ratio; the system obviously can't do any better than this. What you really want is a system with a solid static contrast ratio; this gives you a good range of brightness for each image.

I'm not trying to stand up for drinking and driving, or trying to make high driving look worse, I just wanted to relate the two. It's illogical to say drinking and driving is worse because it causes more accidents, when in reality more people drink, and drink more often, than people that smoke pot, meaning that the stats aren't swayed quite as much as you think they are.

There is nothing wrong with my family, and at worst I'll be kinda bored for the month, but every time I go back I find myself stressing out, having nightmares, and even crying before I finally leave. And after that, it takes me a couple of days to really recover and be my normal self again. Can anyone relate to this? If so, do you have any insights as to why this keeps happening to me? And most importantly, how can I make this whole experience a happy one instead of one that I dread? Possibly relevant info: I am not scared of airplanes or the actual traveling process, but I have other anxiety problems that are mostly under control. I have Xanax for times when I can't quite keep my anxiety under control, but it doesn't seem to help much for all of this (it helps for other anxiety issues).",

About a week and a half ago, there was theft at the hostel. A couple stayed three nights, they were a walk-in, paid cash each day, and when I checked them in, the woman gave me her ID. But then one day the guy broke into someone else's room, stole a set of keys and then the car from the parking lot. We have it all on tape. Police said that the ID was stolen, or at least reported lost or something. But coworkers searched for the name and found a Facebook profile, in the name, with a matching photo even. And another coworker saw them in the city, but they ran. So this morning I work at the other hotel. Looking at the checkouts I see a familiar name. The same one the woman gave at the hostel?! I look up the registration they filled out. Town matches, different address though, but some of it is written differently and this seems odd. Unfortunately no one of the staff present had seen them. Again, they had been here a few days, walk-in, cash. I pulled up that Facebook photo and sent it to the coworker who had checked them in, and she confirmed it's them! I called the police and they sent two cars. One officer used the elevator while three others took the stairs. Me and the owner wait downstairs. All of a sudden the guy comes down the stairs and bolts out the back door. I followed him a little but then thought better of it. He must have seen the cops and hidden on another floor.

The de-facto definition of news and news organizations lies in the perception of those who receive their output. If, for example, a television viewer believes a particular show consistently provides an accurate representation of reality, then for that person, the show is a news provider. If the same viewer has reason to believe that a show misrepresents reality for any reason, be it deception, parody, ignorance, etc. the show ceases to be a provider of news for that viewer, and becomes something else. The problem with Fox specifically is that those who consider them to be a news organization want to believe what they say is true. They neither seek conflicting information nor accept it if offered. This is known as confirmation bias , it is one of the many errors of logic that humans use to filter information, and if the last several thousand years are any indication there is nothing that can be done to change it. For anyone that cares to look, FOX News is clearly NOT a purveyor of facts, i.e. a news organization. For true believers, FOX News provides confirmation of a worldview they would hold with or without FOX News.

There is a fandom out there combining Merida, Hiccup, Jack Frost (from Rise of the Guardians), Rapunzel (from Tangled), and recently Elsa and Anna (from Frozen), it's all works surprisingly well. So the point I'm trying to get to is that in crossovers while the setting (Fantasy, Scifi .etc) does matter and is very important it can become just background, the crossover group I mentioned earlier will usually just create its own story with just the characters and it's like there independent stories never existed.

For lightning, the potential is so high that conductivity doesn't matter nearly as much as distance from cloud to ground (see Coulomb's law and the 1/r^2 dependence), which is why trees, being much less conductive than metal, get struck so often.

I asked my mom for the keys and ran to the bathroom. I peed in a very awkward position and proceeded to jack off. I pull out my phone and open up internet. The problem is sometimes my router goes full retard and stops working which is easily fixable by resetting it, but im too lazy and it would make it to obvious. So I'm standing up ready to masturbate but I have no porn. Normally I can jack off without porn by using my fantastic imagination but I really wanted to hear some moaning so I switched to mobile data and proceeded to look up pornhub on incognito. I get to the website and find the perfect video, but it's not working. After a few minutes I give up the conquest and jack off with my eyes closed imagining my self going down on my crush. Yesterday I was out shopping clothes with my mom and tried to look up prices but my mobile data didn't work so i shot a text at my dad telling him about the problem. About an hour later I before I arrive home it starts to work I start browsing reddit and forget about it. This morning though I couldn't help to ask my dad why my mobile data wasn't working and he told me because I went on an inappropriate website.

    "input_text": "I think i may have a symptom of social anxiety, where i laugh at things that aren't funny, however mostly, if I'm by myself i can stay easily composed. Firstly, i don't mean laughing as in laughing out loud, more of the shaking kind of laugh thats quiet. For example, if i was listening to a coir with friends or family around me (people i knew), and someones voice broke, i would quietly laugh. But sometimes i can't stop laughing, like for minutes i stop and then start again. This is amplified if a friend was to laugh as well, because i would keep laughing as long as there laughing. Another example has occurred when i had to read something out load in class and if i found something funny, i would kind laugh and it my voice would be shaky. This is one example that i think links to social anxiety, because reading out loud can be an uncomfortable task. Now, the worst situation that i laugh in is one thats situated around bad news or a tragedy. If someone told me that a child died or someone i knew or had met died, i would generally feel bad. However, if the tragedy is about someone that i have never met and have no feelings for, then I'm more prone to laughing. Its kind of like i have an empathy gap. An example would be, if a friend told me there friends mother died in a car car crash (this hasn't happened btw). The way they explain it is something that would get to me, almost because i feel like my response is fake. I'm not a person that laughs at anything so this is why i think behaviour is odd. If i could stop this behaviour then i would, and I'm afraid it may affect me in the future.",

To convince the audience he was a better man than Boromir, he had to be tempted and conquer it. so that, combined with the fact they wanted him to go on some kind of personal journey to make his character a little more interesting, is why they changed him so drastically.

I'll get some clean time under my belt (1 month here and there) but I'll always go back to the drugs. I'm at the point where I don't want to do it anymore, but I keep doing it. as I am still an addict and do not know what will work for long periods of time, I will tell you what will NOT work for sure. If he is detoxing and has legs, he WILL find a way to go get high. If he's spending his time with people that are using, he WILL get high. I've found that keeping busy is the best thing to do for an addict. in AA/NA they say there are three alternative for the addict: Jails, institutions and death. I have experience with all three, and jail was just recently about a month ago. For the first time ever, I had to detox without the ability to go and get high and I can tell you it was the worst thing I have ever experienced. Jail straightens alot of people out because of how bad the detox is. it's when they get out of jail and get some sobriety where they forget just how bad the detox was, and they go out and relapse. it's a viscous cycle man, it almost feels like you're fighting a losing battle. Stop spending money on rehab facilities, true change comes from within. if he wants to stop bad enough, he will. if you are going to send him to rehab or somewhere to detox, for the love of god do not let him leave there and go back to the same environment he was using in.. that's asking for a relapse. I could go on with this shit forever, so i'll just leave you with this: Unfortunately, there ain't shit you can do about this. hope that he gets caught stealing something or selling something and is forced to sit in jail for a little bit so he can think about his life and how awesome heroin has made it. It might sound terrible, but at least jail offers guaranteed sobriety.. not to mention it's one of the better three alternatives.",

I think what D3 managed to take from D2 and even expand on it is weaving a fine line between excitation and orderliness. Those may seem a bit contradictory, but that's really how it seems. You feel even more like an epic god of destruction when moving through levels, yet the enemies also have more tricks. Combined, this makes the game even more exciting. At the same time, you have the same nice orderliness of waypoints, teleporting to players, and set number of floors until boss time. The loot goes the same way. The loot is random, which is exciting. Simultaneously, you know when it's coming and that's kind of relaxing almost. Especially now that I don't have to frantically click like a madman when the boss dies. The crafting system has the same nice duality. When random gear drops and you don't need it, it almost feels like there's a round 2 for more excitement. The properties of the loot are random, yet there's the orderliness of knowing what you're putting together and how close you are. The whole game just seems to tap into two opposing parts of your brain for pleasure. There's the typical gaming pleasure that comes from chaos, chance, excitement, action, killing.

When we got there, we discovered there was not enough beds - it was me and my parents, with only one double bed, however we were assured that a camp bed would be brought up shortly. One hour later, no extra bed. So we called reception, and they said the bed was on its way. Some sheets and a doona appeared, still no bed. In the end, the hotel told me that basically i was expected to sleep on the floor. A five star hotel, and i was told to sleep on the floor.

I started working at my first job a little over a year ago while attending school in the mean time and due to those and other priorities, I couldn't find time to work out anymore. I recently left my job and have some free time now so I would like to try to get back into working out and going to the gym. However, like I said, I live with my dad, a single father, and my older brother, both of whom are very lazy and don't really care about their diet. For example, maybe 3 nights a week they will just grab fast food for dinner, the other nights they'll just heat up some TV dinners in the microwave... I don't really have much say in what they buy for the house, so I can't ask them to buy different types of food. So I thought I'd ask all you Redditors here at [SUBREDDIT], if I maintain a not-always-healthy diet like mentioned above, is it extremely difficult to get into good shape?

The assumption behind that is that there are very few racists and the rest of us are not racist. Understanding how racism works, that is not the case. Racism isn't about \"hate\" or even disadvantage; racism is about privilege. The central tenet of racism is that certain people are \"normal,\" \"natural,\" and capable of individuality. So, in Western culture, white is seen as being normal while all others are seen as somehow abnormal. The important part of this is that everyone raised in our culture is taught to think this (including people who aren't white). As a result, everyone is heavily influenced by this racism. If everyone is influenced by this racism, then pointing out or shaming a specific racist is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. We are all racist. So, me pointing out the racism in your desire isn't me saying you are a bad person (I'd guess that you are far from it since you seem to be asking an actual question about something that could feel like a vicious accusation).

Anyway, when I go to change my icons it can look messy and I get confused sometimes, having 39 icons (29 of them being default) it can be a little eyesore with all the various colours, shapes and crudely drawn art sketches of minions, monsters and all the other weird gubbins you find there.

But I mean, the default icons do not even compare in any way, shape or form to the majority of the earned ones, and when you have the option to choose between default or earned, which ones are you gonna pick? So anyway, what I am suggesting is that in the store, under the summoner icons page, you could have the option to disable or enable the default icons. This would really clear out all the clutter of the summoner icon tab when changing an icon, and I think it would be a great addition for some of the older users who have gathered many cool icons over time.

Often some of the greatest laughs in a comedy show come from a reflex line. The comedian builds up a joke around half way through the show and gets a good laugh. He will then find a way to tie the punchline back into his closing joke.
