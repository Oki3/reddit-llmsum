I have also been told that british people, tend to use the word Jungle while American's drum and bass; however, I kinda know this is bullshit because I hear Pete Tong on Essential Mixes time and time again use the term drum and bass as well as other DJs I have met in person (London Elektricty, Goldie)",

If this proposed rule is upheld, I would lose Sabathia, and then I have missed out on the premiere FA pitching batch, putting my team in a really crappy situation. Another example: Pretend we got word that A-Rod was hurt, but after the final FA batch. I then would be completely screwed out of a solid 3B without the chance to sign another.",

Dynamic contrast ratio is the ratio of the luminosity of the brightest and darkest colours the system can produce over a period of time; for instance if you had an almost white image and sometime later an almost black image. As such, they can't be \"converted\" per se. Dynamic contrasting works by lowering the power of the backlight on the TV making the whole image darker but simultaneously amplifying the few pixels which should be coloured/bright. This means it can adjust based on how dark the overall image is allowing you to see dark scenes better. But, the limit on how well you can see those scenes is the static contrast ratio; the system obviously can't do any better than this. What you really want is a system with a solid static contrast ratio; this gives you a good range of brightness for each image.

Being someone that has spent a lot of time in and around bars (grew up in one, have worked in one, still am connected with one), I will say that I know a lot of people that can be over the legal limit, and have no effects of drunkenness. If one of these people were sitting at a stop light while sober (even if over the limit) and a car hit them and killed him, it would be contributed to the drunk driver, and included in the stats (though is probably true for marijuana users too). (Yup, a little more anecdotal evidence here.) Thirdly, about 65% attributed to alcohol than marijuana. This doesn't completely make up for the difference between drinking or smoking while driving, but it does cut them drastic numbers in half. It could be that people who smoke daily may only have a small hit many times throughout the day, never getting \"high\", whereas drinkers don't drink until after work and then have enough to be at or near drunkenness. I'm not trying to stand up for drinking and driving, or trying to make high driving look worse, I just wanted to relate the two.

And another coworker saw them in the city, but they ran. So this morning I work at the other hotel. Looking at the checkouts I see a familiar name. The same one the woman gave at the hostel?! I look up the registration they filled out. Town matches, different address though, but some of it is written differently and this seems odd. Unfortunately no one of the staff present had seen them. Again, they had been here a few days, walk-in, cash. I pulled up that Facebook photo and sent it to the coworker who had checked them in, and she confirmed it's them! I called the police and they sent two cars. One officer used the elevator while three others took the stairs. Me and the owner wait downstairs. All of a sudden the guy comes down the stairs and bolts out the back door. I followed him a little but then thought better of it. He must have seen the cops and hidden on another floor.

    "input_text": "Please define \"News Organization\". Is there a legal definition that holds water? The de-facto definition of news and news organizations lies in the perception of those who receive their output. If, for example, a television viewer believes a particular show consistently provides an accurate representation of reality, then for that person, the show is a news provider. If the same viewer has reason to believe that a show misrepresents reality for any reason, be it deception, parody, ignorance, etc. the show ceases to be a provider of news for that viewer, and becomes something else. The problem with Fox specifically is that those who consider them to be a news organization want to believe what they say is true. They neither seek conflicting information nor accept it if offered. This is known as confirmation bias , it is one of the many errors of logic that humans use to filter information, and if the last several thousand years are any indication there is nothing that can be done to change it. For anyone that cares to look, FOX News is clearly NOT a purveyor of facts, i.e. a news organization. For true believers, FOX News provides confirmation of a worldview they would hold with or without FOX News. If FOX News were suddenly forced to provide only accurate information that conflicted with their viewers perception, they would become former FOX News viewers and seek a more agreeable source of \"information\".",

So, let me assume they will look like BMW in 10 years at which point they would have about $100 billion in revenue. A 10% net margin is what they guided for in the IPO and that means that they will have $10 billion in earnings. Lets assume that due to dilution from paying their employees with shares and raising capital there are 200 million shares outstanding at that time vs. 125 million today. Well $10 billion divided by 200 million shares is $50. If we give it the same PE as BMW of 11 then that would be a $550 share price in 10 years. Of course if they sell 4 million cars at that net margin the share price would be $1100 and if the market still considers it a growth stock in 2024 maybe it gets a PE of 20 and that would be $2200 and then when you add in battery sales you get $4,000. Or, they only have a 5% net margin on 2 million cars which means it is at $275. Or, they never break one million cars and their sales are declining and they only have a 5% net margin but they still have a niche following and the share price is $80/share.

There is a fandom out there combining Merida, Hiccup, Jack Frost (from Rise of the Guardians), Rapunzel (from Tangled), and recently Elsa and Anna (from Frozen), it's all works surprisingly well. So the point I'm trying to get to is that in crossovers while the setting (Fantasy, Scifi .etc) does matter and is very important it can become just background, the crossover group I mentioned earlier will usually just create its own story with just the characters and it's like there independent stories never existed. So in the end I think it's the characters that matter but that's just my opinion.

This happens every time you turn, or drop to the ground (unless your on a mounted gun).

I asked my mom for the keys and ran to the bathroom. I peed in a very awkward position and proceeded to jack off. I pull out my phone and open up internet.

So I'm standing up ready to masturbate but I have no porn.

I get to the website and find the perfect video, but it's not working. After a few minutes I give up the conquest and jack off with my eyes closed imagining my self going down on my crush. Yesterday I was out shopping clothes with my mom and tried to look up prices but my mobile data didn't work so i shot a text at my dad telling him about the problem. About an hour later I before I arrive home it starts to work I start browsing reddit and forget about it. This morning though I couldn't help to ask my dad why my mobile data wasn't working and he told me because I went on an inappropriate website.

    "input_text": "I think i may have a symptom of social anxiety, where i laugh at things that aren't funny, however mostly, if I'm by myself i can stay easily composed. Firstly, i don't mean laughing as in laughing out loud, more of the shaking kind of laugh thats quiet. For example, if i was listening to a coir with friends or family around me (people i knew), and someones voice broke, i would quietly laugh. But sometimes i can't stop laughing, like for minutes i stop and then start again. This is amplified if a friend was to laugh as well, because i would keep laughing as long as there laughing. Another example has occurred when i had to read something out load in class and if i found something funny, i would kind laugh and it my voice would be shaky. This is one example that i think links to social anxiety, because reading out loud can be an uncomfortable task. Now, the worst situation that i laugh in is one thats situated around bad news or a tragedy. If someone told me that a child died or someone i knew or had met died, i would generally feel bad. However, if the tragedy is about someone that i have never met and have no feelings for, then I'm more prone to laughing. Its kind of like i have an empathy gap. An example would be, if a friend told me there friends mother died in a car car crash (this hasn't happened btw). The way they explain it is something that would get to me, almost because i feel like my response is fake. I'm not a person that laughs at anything so this is why i think behaviour is odd. If i could stop this behaviour then i would, and I'm afraid it may affect me in the future.",

Polarising an aura slot is also helpful, as not all auras have the same polarity. An aura in the correct polarity gives double the mod capacity (e.g. Max rank Rifle Amp (7) in the Madurai , but an aura in the wrong slot provides 2 less mod capacity. If you have any expensive mods such as 10-rank mods which are near max, or other expensive mods, then using a forma will help you fit these mods in, however it's probably not worth it if you're trying to fit a low ranked mod like an unranked Rush mod in. If you're really itching to rerank one of your Warframes (or weapons because you can use it on weapons), then changing the Aura polarity to a dash ([Naramon]( is often a safe bet, since a large majority of auras are dash polarity. You could also add a polarity to one of the unpolarised slots, such as a D/[Vazarin]( to fit a high level Vitality or Redirection.

If you objectively step back and look at Faramir and Frodo's meeting in the book, you'll realise nothing reeeallly happens. Other than establishing Faramir is a pretty awesome guy from the get-go.

(especially Boromir, but by this point its already sorely tempted Gandalf, Galadriel and Aragorn) So to then comes along a Human character (as humans are also said to be the most susceptible to its power) who could say something like \"I would not even pick it up if I found it laying in the middle of the road\"... you pretty much just stripped the Ring of all that power you just spent building up. To convince the audience he was a better man than Boromir, he had to be tempted and conquer it. so that, combined with the fact they wanted him to go on some kind of personal journey to make his character a little more interesting, is why they changed him so drastically.

I suddenly came to 2 days later in a hospital bed, where I learned I had broken 17 bones and would not be able to leave the hospital for months. My girlfriend never came and visited me even once during the 5 months I was there, and I even had some family members call her phone, but she seemingly had just vanished. I was heartbroken. But after returning home, I found expensive equipment missing from my apartment: my TV, laptop, iPad, and other items. I was confused and I spent a while tracking her dad's cellphone number down in phone books. When I called him, she answered and cursed me out for \"leaving\" her after I got in the crash. Apparently she thinks I abandoned her by being confined to a hospital bed for months. She told me she smashed all my expensive shit in a rage. Is there anything I can do about this? Any legal options, settlements, etc? My life was already thrown off course by a mile after the crash, and I want to start rebuilding, but this business with my ex has put me down a bit.",

I'll get some clean time under my belt (1 month here and there) but I'll always go back to the drugs. I'm at the point where I don't want to do it anymore, but I keep doing it. as I am still an addict and do not know what will work for long periods of time, I will tell you what will NOT work for sure. If he is detoxing and has legs, he WILL find a way to go get high. If he's spending his time with people that are using, he WILL get high. I've found that keeping busy is the best thing to do for an addict. in AA/NA they say there are three alternative for the addict: Jails, institutions and death. I have experience with all three, and jail was just recently about a month ago. For the first time ever, I had to detox without the ability to go and get high and I can tell you it was the worst thing I have ever experienced. Jail straightens alot of people out because of how bad the detox is. it's when they get out of jail and get some sobriety where they forget just how bad the detox was, and they go out and relapse. it's a viscous cycle man, it almost feels like you're fighting a losing battle. Stop spending money on rehab facilities, true change comes from within. if he wants to stop bad enough, he will. if you are going to send him to rehab or somewhere to detox, for the love of god do not let him leave there and go back to the same environment he was using in.. that's asking for a relapse. I could go on with this shit forever, so i'll just leave you with this: Unfortunately, there ain't shit you can do about this. hope that he gets caught stealing something or selling something and is forced to sit in jail for a little bit so he can think about his life and how awesome heroin has made it.

You feel even more like an epic god of destruction when moving through levels, yet the enemies also have more tricks. Combined, this makes the game even more exciting. At the same time, you have the same nice orderliness of waypoints, teleporting to players, and set number of floors until boss time. The loot goes the same way. The loot is random, which is exciting. Simultaneously, you know when it's coming and that's kind of relaxing almost. Especially now that I don't have to frantically click like a madman when the boss dies. The crafting system has the same nice duality. When random gear drops and you don't need it, it almost feels like there's a round 2 for more excitement. The properties of the loot are random, yet there's the orderliness of knowing what you're putting together and how close you are.

The assumption behind that is that there are very few racists and the rest of us are not racist. Understanding how racism works, that is not the case. Racism isn't about \"hate\" or even disadvantage; racism is about privilege. The central tenet of racism is that certain people are \"normal,\" \"natural,\" and capable of individuality. So, in Western culture, white is seen as being normal while all others are seen as somehow abnormal. The important part of this is that everyone raised in our culture is taught to think this (including people who aren't white). As a result, everyone is heavily influenced by this racism. If everyone is influenced by this racism, then pointing out or shaming a specific racist is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. We are all racist. So, me pointing out the racism in your desire isn't me saying you are a bad person (I'd guess that you are far from it since you seem to be asking an actual question about something that could feel like a vicious accusation).
