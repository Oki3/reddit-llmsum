I ran off after him but he had disappeared. 10 hours later, his dad phoned to say he had arrived safely at his apartment in Edinburgh, Scotland. The kid had hitchhiked 300 miles, barefoot. He returned home after spending six months with his dad, during which he shoplifted and truanted from school. Years later, I disowned him after a string of robberies and assaults were linked to him. He got his girl pregnant so he joined the army but they split up when he went to prison for going AWOL too many times. His mother died two years later and our relationship went into a steep decline ending in his permanent banishment from our home. He burgled the house repeatedly, threatened his brothers and assaulted his father until he finally ended up in prison for beating up his ex's new boyfriend. No matter what he did, his brothers stood by him which made it almost impossible for me to maintain any control over the situation. In desperation, I started to spend more and more time away, assuming that the less I was around, the sooner the situation would return to normal. It didn't. We hadn't spoken in years when I spotted him walking past a cafe I was in with his brothers. I'd just been paid and had given each of them a wad of cash and I wanted to give him his share, no matter what our differences. Before I had a chance to give him his envelope, he turned and stalked away. That was the last I saw of him until recently when we became friends on Facebook. He's in his late twenties now and, while he'll always have a bit of a Viking temperament, he seems to have calmed down enough to invite to my wedding.",

When I see the lower elo players in game I never see any true adjustments to what the enemy team is buying or what is needed in that match. What I see is that they have a set desire on what they want to buy based off of what has worked before. It has become a common occurrence I have noticed and the shift is ridiculous and sometimes I feel it truly does define why some games are lost by teams. I see Lee Sins who instead of building tank items get a hydra in bronze while the plat players I play with get the randuins because that is what is needed to win.

Usually it's $200-$300 and they've just been delayed and I can get proof of them - Not in these two cases. The first one was $850 and since I was the one whose name was on the paperwork, I was responsible to pay it back after going round and round with the bank. That was a year ago. I paid it back, done. Oh, but we're not done yet. It's happened AGAIN this year, this time to the tune of $1016. 2 solid calendar weeks have gone by before I'd heard that it never cleared the bank - WTF? So, this time I'm more than likely looking at being fired if I can't get it resolved - at the VERY minimum having to pay this one back as well - which will in turn knock my take-home pay down about 50%, including my wage garnishment for an old student loan, and a mandatory \"reimbursement\" to my company because I got overpaid (not my fault - our payment processor's fault).

    "input_text": "I think of it this way: I used to love purchasing CDs. Having the actual disk, the case with the artwork, the booklet with the liner notes, etc. All of that made up part of the experience of a new album. The feeling of taking the disk out of the case for the first time, seeing hidden artwork behind the CD, reading the lyrics in the booklet. A new album had a physical and visual component to it, rather than just the audio quality. Then came along the popularity of mp3s. The audio remained, but everything else was dropped for the most part. It's almost the same for books. Having the touch of pages, the smell of a new book, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love those things too, but the ease of reading an e-book is what is making them so popular, just like mp3s. And for the people who complain about having to pay over $100 for an e-reader itself? Remember the iPod? They were around $400 when they first came out. Standard size ones are still over $100 (IIRC). Although not entirely the same situation, there are many similarities. Just as CD stores have suffered a bit from mp3 sales, book stores will see relatively similar results. But I agree with you in a way. I used to be a huge fan of physical books, their smell, etc. However, more recently I have adapted to using an e-reader and love everything about it. It's one of those things that once you try, it's hard to go back. I tried reading a physical book that wasn't available on the Kindle and found it much more stressful. It might not seem like much, but holding the book up, dealing with it trying to close if it's a larger book, turning the pages, etc. With an e-reader you are able to sink yourself into the story with ease.",

The grinding brings back memories from maplestory, RO1, and other grindy mmos. It also brings in a social aspect that I have not seen in a long long time. More often then not when I form a farming party we get talking about ourselves and whats going on in our lives and become instant friends. I have had more social interactions in this closed beta than I have had in the entirety of the last year in MMOs. It makes the grinding fun and personal on a whole other level. When you're up at those high levels it actually feels like something was completed, some insurmountable achievement under your belt. You finally get to that class you wanted to reach and it -feels- like you're that bad-ass class, not just some novice who somehow in 2 days got to a really high rank. It removes the meaning of the higher classes if the leveling speed is exceptionally faster. Another point I want to make is that too much these days you hear \"The game starts when you hit max level\". Okay? So you're telling me I have to hit endgame for the game to be enjoyable? What about before then? So basically close my eyes and spam to max level ASAP. Okay. You see, the thing I liked about grindy MMOs like this is that it really puts emphases on the journey, and not the destination. Mix a few quests and some gear enhancement systems and you've got me hooked. I feel like max level should be almost unreachable, and when it is achieved, the person who did it basically goes down in gaming history. Like in maplestory, if you mention fangblade, almost everyone is gonna know who he is. (The first person to hit the old level cap).",

However, at the 2nd to last town, it would not allow me to claim the town saying this would make the French too weak! Pretty much seems like a fail safe to keep the 4 nations on the map permanently. When I went back to Tampa to then claim it for the Spanish side atleast, figuring since I can't claim it myself atleast I would remove the French from there, it did not allow me to that either due to the same reason.

You go to the moment before any choice in anyone's life, no matter how small or big the choice. Say the person chose to eat a bagel over cereal for breakfast one morning. Now rewind to the moment before that choice once again. No matter how many times the person makes that choice, they are always going to make the same choice. They made that choice based on the total of all their life experience up until that point, and their innate preferences (possibly genetic). If given that same choice, at that same point in time (Without anything about their history or preferences changing) an infinite number of times, they will always choose the bagel. So they didn't really make a choice, it was dictated all along by every moment in their life before that one. Sure that same person could choose cereal over a bagel the next day, but that is because they ate a bagel the day before and they had 24 hours of experiences between those 2 choices. They didn't change their mind about their original choice, eating cereal is just another act that they did, because there was nothing else they could possibly do. I can't see how there can possibly be freewill when all of your thoughts and actions are made based on all of the things you have experienced before that choice.

Halo 3 default infection had similar issues, but to a far smaller extent. No AA. Pistol was powerful, but the lack of a scope and slower fire rate made it more balanced. Maps were also much better. Still, zombies were by and large underpowered. The Forge community didn't help the map situation, considering most Infection maps in Halo 3 were also 'Zombie City' maps made on Foundry by throwing together some walls, fences, boxes and windows and calling it a city. The best Infection maps are dedicated maps and gametypes designed in favour of the zombies. Zombies which are given routes around the maps which gives them an edge over the humans.

The trick is to be silent afterwards. If it makes you nervous start thinking about how to make a sandwich or something. This will make you appear nonchalant. Step 4: Wait. Wait approx. 30 seconds. 30 seconds of silence is a lot of silence but for you it's enough time to finish making your mental sandwich. This is when you go in for the kill.

This is an example of the socratic method, using questions to draw out knowledge and forces the narrator to engage in critical thinking. The story of the leavers illustrates that there isn't just one way for human beings to act, but thousands, each suited to the conditions and environment of the community they develop in. The wisdom of the Navajo would have little practical use for the Ta\u00edno. The takers force their wisdom/ideology upon primitive cultures and destroy those that do not assimilate (Cain vs Abel, Colonists vs Indigenous people everywhere). This isn't really a requirement per se, your professor is just trying to make sure that you produce a cogent paper. I would keep in mind that Quinn isn't against ALL agriculture, merely the aggressive form practiced by Western Civilization. He is suggesting that humans should live in tribes, as they have for 98% of their existence and should realize that they exist as part of the environment, rather than in opposition to it. I don't want to do your homework for you, so I'll just suggest that you look into Anarcho-Primitivism, especially Derrick Jensen, who has been heavily influenced by Quinn's ideas.

Next thing, from what you say about yourself, I will echo what everyone here has already said, 75 is waaay to soft for your size, let alone any strength, so you should be seeing flex pretty easily, and with your size, and assuming you to be above average in terms of strength, even a 100lb flex point should still show flex under your weight.

A couple of things I can glean from the photos and what they say is that they us a 3k carbon weave, and the taper on the stick appears to be a standard taper. A standard tapper doesn't have a ton of low kick, and usually has a uniform flex point, much like a wooden hockey stick (something Bauer dressed up in their nexus line and charged a premium for). What this means for your hand positioning is that your lower hand needs to be fairly low on the stick to get the pop composites are known for. One other thing, seeing as you are fairly new to the sport, are you trying to shoot on the move? If you've been playing for less than a year, chances are your not transferring your weight properly in your release if you are moving.

At this point in the story he started to get visibly annoyed. He said that he wouldn't go for any tests, because he could guarantee that he didn't have anything.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that our midfield is not what it used to be but I don't see why we aren't just looking to promote from within. Rafinha has shown all season that he is a very solid player and I think if he's given consistent minutes he can become world class. He fits in very well with the changing system that we have now, he has some very promising potential and a good relationship with lucho. Not only that, but we also have to consider players like Denis Su\u00e1rez and Sergi Samper and even Halilovic further down the road. From what I've seen from Sergi Samper, he looks like the real deal. I believe that he could be one of the next barca greats, but if we buy a young midfielder like Pogba, Veratti or Kovacic, there will be even less of a place for our young players. Iniesta and Xavi are on the decline in terms of what they can handle physically, but Rakitic and Busquets are not going anywhere. Busquets could still be anchoring our midfield for another 8 years as he's only 26. If we buy another 23 year old they're going to be expected to be playing there for many years, and then there won't be another consistent starting spot in the midfield until Rakitic either leaves or grows old like Xavi and Iniesta. Not to mention that Iniesta could still be a pretty consistent starter next year. If Xavi leaves, Iniesta is still first Captain and your first captain isn't a supersub. My point is that we have spent all this time developing talent from La Masia that I think we really need to start investing in it once again at the highest level, sure it isn't the golden generation we have had in the past but there are some players there that are very clearly going to be world class talents.",

If you think back, when they were team alternate, they crushed LCS and played very well, with their MVP Forellenlord. Then suddenly Forellenlord was kicked and they picked up kevin, who is doing really well so far. They problem now: Kerp is ok in midlane earlyphase, but not godlike. But the main problem existing - Millenium doesnt communicate well, it seems to be a lack of a shotcaller - which was meant to be Forellenlord. Kerb just cant fulfill this role. What im asking now: Forellenlord still is a free agent, top 20 challenger and to the opposite of kerp a REAL midlaner(kerp switched from top to mid), Millenium should just shake off their proud and pick him up again. I dont see there any chance staying in LCS for millenium otherwise. Forellenlord got godlike mechanics and is a good shotcaller, as he has shown last season.

There are many reasons why they stay that way. The consumer demands what they are used to, all the way down to the size of the box. General Mills and Kelloggs both [test marketed]( a bag in box cereal that was more effective in size to hold more product with less packaging. People didn't buy them. So the reasoning for the shape and bag in box is consumer driven. If people will buy less of a product with new packaging, why spend the money to develop new equipment, processes, packaging, and machinery. The reason for the few inches of headspace is for the artificial atmosphere and ease of processing. Imagine how many boxes of cereal a factory will churn out in a day, they need equipment uptime and reliability. If they pack the bag full, they will spill product, and have an improper seal. The headspace will allow the sealing machinery to seal the product effectively without damaging the product.",

The way this comes about is a patient will come in to the hospital after a trauma, or come to my attention as a consult after a major event and one of the doctors or EMS people on the field told the patient's family that they are brain dead or in a coma or something similarly dire I don't know what is actually being said to the families, but by the time i get there the family thinks the person is in a coma, brain dead, vegetative or whatever. Usually a quick neurological exam at the bedside will let me tell them that the patient is in fact, not brain dead, or not in a coma. the family attributes this to a miracle, while it was actually either a misunderstanding or an over-call by the initial doctors.

Brain death is pretty specific and irrevesible, you aren't brain dead until you are in fact brain dead and you can't be a little brain dead.

But you know what, no matter what it is perfectly fine. You don't need a diagnosis and nothing is 'wrong' with you. I know personally that most people see me as a rather social, out-going person but I slip up socially every now and then. Sometimes I say something the moment I think of it, then realise I've offended someone or taken a sarcastic comment seriously. I think the real reason is that social protocols change in so many situations and often don't make sense.

Go and read the article but look how she describes how she treated the dog. From reading the article it sounds like before she had her kids she treated the dog as a baby and not as an pet. I think that largely plays a role in her attitude towards the dog after she had a baby. If you are using the animal as a substitute for a child then of course once you have the real thing you will have no need for the substitute. It also sounds like she picked a needy breed of dog. Some dogs require a lot of attention and care while other dogs just need a bowl of food and water. Picking a needy dog when you don't have a lot of free time is going to cause problems. Add in that it sounds like she didn't do a good job training her dog and that's going to compound the problems. A good portion of her complaints are about not having the time to properly care for the dog and that is something that will effect your feelings for the animal. Having three kids is a consuming task so adding in a needy dog is only going to add to that.

Unfortunately, there was a couple sitting on the fucking floor, blocking us from leaving.

After all, we work in advertising, and somehow these companies have convinced people to consume something that will kill them. If there was only some other product that could fulfill all that smoking does without the danger, you'd become instantly very very rich. There has to be something intrinsically related to cigarettes, beyond the buzz, beyond the chemical addiction, beyond some generic concept of coolness that makes them so appealing. Here's what we decided on. Cigarette smoking is controllable social segmentation. You're at a party where you don't know anybody? No problem, your people are there for you on the balcony or patio. There's always something to talk about. Oh, you smoke blacks? I smoke reds. Plus an entire system of stereotypes to conform to or subvert in your own way. Cigarette smoking is always an excuse to break from something unpleasant. Don't like the current company? Don't like how work is going? Take a smoke break. When you're a cigarette smoker, you're never bored. Because there's always something to do, always a cigarette to be smoked. And most fundamentally (my partner studied psychology and gave a great argument for this) cigarette smoking is fundamentally related to the act of breathing, which is one of our most basic purest instincts. Very few products modify breathing in a way that builds social proof. It's a very zen hybrid of introverted and extroverted satisfactions.",

Muscles are like those cheap appliances that have no \"on/off\" switch, but automatically turn on whenever they are plugged in. There is no separate \"off\" neurotransmitter. Either the muscle neurotransmitter is going, or it isn't. If your muscles are contracting, then it is going. If they are relaxed, then it is not going and the cells have eliminated whatever neurotransmitter was there. Ever wonder where rigor mortis comes from? That's when those nerve cells release all their reserves of that neurotransmitter. The now-dead cells can't clear it away like they did in life, so all the muscles stiffen and remain contracted until the neurotransmitter degrades. Continuing on from semantics, I can find no studies that show acupuncture can single out specific muscles and cause relaxation. The most that has been published by non-biased journals shows that it has an overall pain-relieving effect via triggering [endorphins]( AKA endogenous morphines, and can [stimulate the parasympathetic system]( AKA body-wide relaxation. Granted, this stimulation occurs through as-yet-unknown mechanisms, but if you have some insight into the molecular physiology of the pathway there are plenty of young researchers who would be thrilled to co-publish with you.",

Back then my pride and joy was my Pokemon LeafGreen, which had my legitimate Shiny gyarados (not Lake of Rage, found as a Magikarp) which i had trained to Level 100. Also on that file were every one of my legendaries which I had traded over from other games, and all my favorite Pokemon. Anyways, at the party, everyone was having a great time, playing Pokemon and everything. The time to cut the cake had arrived, so we all were heading over to the Kitchen. When we came back, I didn't find any game cartridge in my GameBoy. I panicked for 30 minutes straight. Everyone was still there and none of them claimed to know where the game was. At that point I was so disappointed I began to cry (probably for more than 10 minutes straight). Later that weekend, my friend called saying that my game was stolen and who took it. Apparently it was one of his friends who I didnt know very well, and lived 2 hours away from us. One year ago, I found that the person who stole my game also stole multiple of my other friends' games, and he went to our school. Turns out he was a really nice guy and we're now best friends, although I still give him shit about stealing my LeafGreen.",

This always seems to happen but about a few weeks (sometimes months) something switches on or off in her brain, and things suddenly start turning for the worse.

That summer most of my friends had some home for a few weeks from college, and my friend D invited me and some other friends one night to go drive around with him. We were bored and spent several nights that summer just driving around at night exploring. We drove about 10 minutes south of where I live and out onto some rural roads in his car, just cruising, seeing what we could see. We did this several times and found some pretty cool roads that were pitch black at night. At the time I had an F150, and we started taking it out at night. When we got there everyone would pile into the bed of the truck except for the driver, and then we would fly down these bumpy back roads with the wind blowing in our faces. During one of the instances, I was in the bed, and another friend, who is a pretty crazy driver, was driving my truck. We were flying through curves and over bumps, and then in a moment of flat, calm road, I stopped hanging on and sat down on the side of the truck bed. A few seconds later we hit a huge dip on a slight curve, and my ass lost contact with the side of the truck, my body completely in the air. With nothing to hold onto, I felt myself falling backwards for an instant, and my instinct seemed to be to hold my and legs out to balance myself, which only felt scarier, and as time stretched into what seemed several seconds (in reality it was an instant, and I was probably less than an inch above the side) I thought surely I was going to thrown out at probably 40 mph. Somehow I landed back on my ass and balanced myself again on the side, my arms flailing to stop myself from teetering over. I immediately sat back down in the bed, having avoided I'm sure several broken bones and serious road rash if not death.",

No other food was allowed to be bought or kept in the block. Now, the rule that no one is meant to break is fucking with someones bread. Because if the guards go on strike you literally don't eat you're locked in your cell with water and bread. (Most jails are now run privately but use to be all be run by the government this was 16 years ago) At first I was like, 'No way, they have to feed you, they have to have guards people to look after shit'. Well apparently not, some guards did go for the $$$ not enough to monitor everyone and feed everyone. Now I'm not sure why, but shitting in stuff is super popular in jail. Especially women's jail ( Another personal story) And people would shit in beds, pillow cases , under the mattress. X was cunning , never really getting caught and never really not noticing, like how do you lay your head in a pillowcase full of shit. (This kind of stuff did you get you bashed but not really a big deal apparently) Most inmates had two pairs of shoes, X was down to one pair. And this Aboriginal fellow shat in his shoes and managed to get bay powder to mask the scent. 'Oh know he stepped in shit' But wait, there is more. This was literally two weeks before his release. So X for two weeks ripped a hole in his mattress , and shat in it. For two weeks. Non stop. Shitting in his mattress and sleeping on the floor. The day before his release he switched the beds when he got a chance and while that was happening also shat in his bread. So this Aboriginal is left with a mattress filled with shit, can't swap it. Can't get a new one. Until someone else leaves.",

A: irony. unsinkable ship sinks its just like the too big to fail bank jokes a few years ago. B: there is obvious human error involved. any number of things could have helped in the tragedy of the titanic and human error is funny in hindsight. the two tower incident (or 911) is similarly unfunny for a few reasons. A: their was no accident those people meant to do what they did(or almost did in a few cases). these people willingly killed themselves for the sake of killing others. its like the thought of a kamikaze to a world war 2 vet the feelings are similar. the Idea of a hatred so powerful that it overrides the survival instinct is scary. B: the location. people die in the sea and we all know this it's practically a racial memory the 911 thing happened in the middle of a sizable island. this isn't normal land tragedy are paths of destruction not a few buildings in particular. C: the buildings were monuments landmarks. landmarks aren't suppose to be hurt it's common courtesy and if you don't have that on the battlefield war becomes a worse hell than most can imagine. D: the weapon. humans in general don't like flight the idea of falling is scary for obvious reasons. and knowing that any vehicle you could be in that fly's could be used in a plot like this is once again scary. the real thing that keeps 911 from being funny is the fact that A: the landmark thing again and B: we just don't have enough safety precautions for an event like this to be stopped (at least not ones that the civilian populace can understand and easily communicate to others) for us to put our fears to rest.",

Making yourself stronger will inherently make you better at metcons, it doesn't work vice versa. I.e. increasing the amount of push ups you can do in a 10 minute span won't increase your bench press max. To put in in another perspective, take two people.

Previously he's been vocal on things like internet censorship, clergy-based child abuse, media classification (one of the loudest opponents of R-rated games), and pretty much everything that can be thought of with an anti-gay perspective. To be fair, the vast majority of Australian Christians do not support the strength of his views, even if they share similar ones. For instance, Christians I know might say that gays have a risky lifestyle due to AIDS, but they wouldn't go on and say that smoking was better than being gay. The media loves him, because he makes great press. His followers support him, because he's technically right on matters of faith (as I understand it - but bible knowledge is not one of my strengths).

So we decided to take a hiatus so that we could take some time to get to know our community better, figure out what they wanted to see from us, and also so that we could spend a few weeks reflecting on our show. During this time, we made lots of improvements to our workflow, and figured out ways to make the show more interesting to our viewers. Communicating with individual fans helped a lot. Our biggest fear was that our audience wouldn't be there once we were ready to come back, but when we released our first new episode last Tuesday, we found that our community was stronger than ever. We picked up lots of new fans via Twitter, Facebook, iTunes, and a few other outlets, and we found that people really appreciated all the improvements we'd made.

A lot of crazy shit happened, including a camper being sent home for pulling a knife on the rest of the unit, but my favorite was the summer we were besieged by bears. This family of bears just decided they didn't give a fuck and started brazenly traipsing through the tent units to get to the dumpster behind the kitchen.

Finally the dumpster was moved and the bears went away, but the girls were still nervous about sleeping in the unit. We (the counselors) decided the best way to deal with their fear was to work them into a blood frenzy. We had 20 twelve year old girls dancing around a campfire with mud on their faces singing about bringing the head of the bear back on a pike. One girl ran off and pissed in the treehouse to 'mark our territory.' We slept in the unit that night, and the counselors were all pretty on edge despite all our bravado. We had pots and pans next to our beds ready to start clankin' at the first sign of bear activity. Then, around midnight, we heard something big walking through the campsite. THIS IS IT, we thought. We all sprang upright in bed, whaling on that crockery like our lives and the lives of 20 minors depended on it and screaming the Little Red Wagon song at the top of our lungs.

    "generated_summary": "The poster recommends at least a $100 radar detector that can detect RADAR and LIDAR, but notes that LIDAR, commonly used by highway patrol, is problematic because it works with lasers in the visible spectrum, making it difficult for the detector to warn users until it's too late. LIDAR is also only detected when it's pointed directly at the vehicle, and it needs a clear line of sight. Additionally, radar detectors are largely ineffective on highways, and most devices only beep when speeds exceed 10 MPH over the limit, except during the end of the month when officers might enforce speeding laws more aggressively to meet ticket quotas.

Now, my theory is this: the center of the galaxy is the beginning of multiplayer. Specifically, I think it's there that you will earn the ability to form parties or track your friends. Think about it. Sean said that they will have traditional multiplayer (either planned or at least \"not at launch\", whatever that means) and one of the main limitations would be that your friends would be so far away, spread across the quintillion stars. It would be unlikely to ever run into anyone because of the sheer vastness of the galaxy. But that's the thing. Everyone is being funneled into this central point. So eventually, the likelyhood of running into somebody is going to skyrocket the closer you get to the center. I feel a little skeptical even myself about this theory, though, so I submit as an alternative that a more likely possible scenario would be a sort of \"lobby\" planet in the center to meet your friends at and to go explore. I expect people will be phased in and out (like ESO's Megaserver, or Destiny's tower) but people on your list will have priority.

He is not afraid when it's light in the room and maybe you're using it to look under a couch or something, but when the house is dark he hates it The issue is whenever we're in the same house at night (we go to his nan's holiday house alone sometimes, sleepovers) I always use it when I get up to go to the bathroom or get something, it's just habit and I do it at home all the time, he wants me to just turn on the lights instead but its so much more effort, and it would hurt my eyes (try turning on a light next time you're in bed ;P) We always argue about it whenever I do it, I think it's just not a big deal and such a stupid fear, he can't describe why he doesn't like it, and he gets so angry about it!

I'm building a text-based game, or \"simulator\", where you are the captain of a starship in a random procedural galaxy. One big part of the game using functionning ships. The entire idea behind my game is the fact that in Star Trek, they often \"rewire\" a subsystem to make it do something else. I came up with the idea of have \"energies\", like Electromagnetic Radiation, and wavelengths associated with them, like Radio Waves, Light, Gamma waves, etc. Each radiation, if channeled in a certain way (as a beam, a cone or a field surrounding the ship) will have a certain effect, like heating the target's hull, disrupting power generation, protecting against beams of a certain energy, etc. In theory, you can modify an X Ray laser weapon to emmit Infrared Lasers, but at a cost of energy and damage to the subsystem. I added sci fi energies also, like one that is mostly used in weapons and another that is used in shielding. That part, even if complicated, I'm proud of. The problem is making some kind of subsystem \"system\" to implement this while staying simple enough for a command-line game. I know it's retro, but for now I don't have much choice. Either I design a complex system of interconnected subsystems, where one produces energy, channels it to a capacitor, which then channels it to different systems, which output it, or I do some simple stuff, like subsystems acting as \"abilities\" where you need the correct ammount of a certain energy for it to work. Is there some in-between? Some of my problem is programming (how is the AI going to use this), which this sub is not for, but the other part is the usefulness of it for a player.

Specificity = True Negatives / (False Positives + True Negatives) as false positives go up, specificity goes down. When I look at the bipolar patients and calculate sensitivity and specificity (using the criteria they chose, that nonviolent attempts do not count), I get 95.5% sens / 23.1% spec. This is truly basic statistics. So the way they calculated a 96% specificity is bullshit as far as I can tell. It looks like they took True Negative / All negative = 96%. This calculation actually gives you the negative predictive value (NPV) of this test for suicide in a bipolar population. The NPV can be helpful in characterizing a test but should never be confused with the specificity and is highly dependent on the prevalence of suicide in the tested population - it's not intrinsic to the test. Looking further in the paper they have this jewel of a line: >The present computation evokes interesting theoretical issues regarding the interpretation of the concept of specificity. For example, is the observed high raw specificity due to a low background frequency of suicides or to a high frequency of suicide preventing reactivity? There are no \"theoretical issues\" regarding interpretation of specificity, they just calculated the NPV instead, which is known to vary with prevalence (or \"background frequency\") of the condition of interest.",

Bosch's [Garden of Earthly Delights]( for example. An atheist who disdains the cultural contributions of religion is as ignorant and immature as the believer he scorns.

There is only one tiny little caveat to this: Signed transactions are valid on both chains! So while you're correct that in theory, the two chains could be used independently, this will not be the case in reality. To illustrate let's say you're buying something from me and you're paying me with bitcoins on the new chain. You broadcast the transaction and I get the new bitcoins. So far so good. But now I'm kind of an asshole and I take your transaction and also broadcast it on the old chain. BOOM! I get your old bitcoins too and there's not much you can do about it. The only way to prevent the above scenario is if a transaction is being broadcast on both chains, but only gets included into a block on one of them, but not on the other. That way there exists a short window where the unconfirmed transaction on the one chain can be \"doublespent\", aka sent to a different address instead. Now you have your coins in two different addresses on the two chains, and therefore they're really separated. Because this is extremely confusing to the user, I would assume that there will be nodes intentionally connecting the two chains by broadcasting all transaction on both chains simultaneously. But because one chain has a larger blocksize than the other, there will necessarily be cases where intentional or unintentional splitting of coins between the two chains happens. And while it is not clear which chain will be the \"winner\", those split coins might actually be worth less than the others, because they are only valid on one chain but not on the other.",

The author suggests that nodes may intentionally connect the two chains to prevent such issues, but size differences between the chains could lead to coin splitting.",

Just wanted to talk a little about my current gaming set-up. Was gaming on 360 for a number of years, before talk of the new consoles really got off the ground. Sounded exciting. Got into Reddit around the same time, and all the modded Skyrim screenshots over on r/skyrim made me realise... Next-gen was already here. Saved a little, and built a rig with some excellent advice from the kind folks over on r/buildapc. Dropped about \u00a3800, which is a lot, but remain convinced that I've already made enough savings via Steam sales to justify it - plus, I've had some outstanding gaming experiences in the meantime, and will continue to for a long time yet. The only games out of my reach were the first-party Nintendo stuff. So I recently picked up a Wii U - and you don't need me to tell you how much you can get out of the system.

I got a C- in math because I hated it and it made me feel like shit every day because I refused to pay attention for some reason. Junior year, I basically failed Pre-Calculus (well, my teacher passed me with a D) both semesters, I was failing Chemistry at one point second semester (I was planning on dropping it, so I didn't try, but they ended up not letting me) and I didn't read my books on time in English. Senior year, I still don't give a shit and don't pay much attention in class, but it doesn't really matter that much because my schedule was easy and I didn't reallt have to try that hard. Now I'm in college, like I said, and I still have a shitty work ethic. I don't want to put effort into subjects I don't care about/have no interest in. I was supposed to read a chapter out of my anthropology book, which I'm not going to do because maybe we really won't have to ( yeah yeah yeah ...) and I really don't want to. I am dropping my stats class tomorrow because I don't want to go through math class again because it drives me insane and frustrated the shit out of me when I get behind (which is because I don't pay attention). I am aware that I sound like a complete loser, but that's how I feel. I can't seem to get it through my thick skull that I need to succeed at this. Maybe it's because I don't have an end goal (I don't know what I want to pursue for sure). Is all this normal? How do I get motivated and give a shit? Do I have ADD? Do I need adderall? Is college not for me?",

If it's more of the latter, and there's more development planned for Clarksburg, then that's where M-83 comes in.

I was feeling down yesterday about my weight and weight loss, just being mad that I let myself get this fat and wishing it would happen faster... also feeling completely unattractive... the typical negative self talk. Anyway, I decided to weigh myself this morning. The first time I weighed myself was 3 weeks after I started calorie counting and exercising regularly so I don't know my actual starting weight. I imagine it was somewhere along the lines of 225lbs or so at 5'7\". On June 27th i weighed 217lbs. Anyway, today I weighed in at 205lbs! I'm so close to being below 205, it's very exciting! Another thing that's crazy and I did the basic math 12lbsx3500 calories = 42000 calorie deficit. 42000/35 days = 1200 calorie deficit per day. Which is quite close to what I've been aiming for at a 1000 calorie deficit most days. Really renews my faith that I'm doing the right thing and that calorie counting is working for me after all. I'm excited to take pictures in a few days, hopefully I'll see a diff after 2 months, I couldn't really see them after the first month despite most of my clothes being very loose. I can now take off all my pants without unbuttoning them! Thanks for the support, I love seeing everyone's progress - it's always so encouraging and picks me up on a shitty day.",

I had eventually learned that he was cheating on my mom with another woman. I even got to read the actual letters from the other woman that was sent to him. It's contents contained comments on sex, her knowing he had a family and her missing him etc... My mother decided to give him a second chance to work things out and be a family again. During this second chance is when he left. Ever since then, I never heard from him. Neither my siblings or I received so much as a simple birthday card even. No phone calls or letters, nothing. I have since been left wondering \"Why?\". Growing up, this has been gnawing at me for a great deal of time, wondering why he did the things he did. What was wrong with me for him to do such actions, if he had other kids and what not. Sometimes I get curious and Google whatever I could find on him. Which leads me to my current situation. I believe I have found the residence of him and his girlfriend(?)'s home. I would like to write him a letter asking why and also to vent what I feel towards him. I have spoken with my mother about this, but she feels I might end up being hurt from not getting the answers I am looking for from my father. I feel this could be true sadly as well. I also feel like if he ever told others about us, he might have painted my mother to be the villain who wouldn't let him see his children, which is entirely untrue. I guess I fear his denial as well :/ Would this even be a good idea? Perhaps cathartic at the very least? Or would I just be hurting myself?

I am not advocating that you make obtaining money your whole life goal, but you've gotta realize that life is easier when you've got more of it.

PvP is obvious, the difference vs PvE and PvM is that PvE is essentially the whole game without PvP (what you do) whereas PvM means vs Monsters (before: really hard bosses, now: any monsters) The tag of PvE has mostly fallen into disuse in RS though. In Runescape PvM evolved at first to mean high level bossing, so PvM was equated to high difficulty (relative) monsters such as GWD/KQ/KBD (before Kiln/Corp/Nex). Years ago (Before dung. Before Nex. Before extremes, before gravestones even) PvM clans were less popular and more elite and a helluva lot more fun imho, but that's neither here nor there. Anyways PvM was the pinnacle of awesomeness. Owning a full phat set was not as sexy as being part of a real known PvM clan, staking was it's own beast and impressive in it's own right, but PvM was still toping the charts. For some reason flippers command more respect that PvM bossers now, this used to be the opposite. As such PvM was difficult and elite, a holy grail of sorts and the meaning has changed over the years (Can be seen by forums as well, used to have PvP and PvM forums, now Monsters) It annoys me too because I feel like lower levels are pissing on what I used to feel RS was by naming themselves PvM, even though since the meaning has sort of evolved to include PvE it's hard to blame them.",

But the real fun is how the theatre ended up haunted. You see, in 1936 a outbreak of fatal tornadoes tore through the town and left a path of devastation. Our hospital ran out of space, so they started taking the injured to the Lyric instead. The lobby was transformed into a makeshift operating room where they used the popcorn machines to sterilize the surgical tools. Plywood was ripped from the walls and laid over the seats in the theatre so serve as beds. The sheriff at the time admitted to euthanizing at least one person in the theatre who was considered beyond help. They stored bodies under the stage to keep them cool and out of view.

Sounds easy, but when you're moving around gathering items you gotta stay aware of when and where spawns happen. Doordashing. The final level has 2 doors which also run on timers, but the Mercenary is able to dash through them if he has enough movement speed. 6 Goat Hooves is enough, if you didn't manage to get 6, you damage boost instead (which is slower). On Monsoon this saves 1,5 minutes, on Rainstorm 1 minute. Providence. There's two tricks to killing him as fast as possible. The first is to focus on items that pierce his damage shield (every 30% hp, he puts up a shield reducing all direct damage to 1 for a while). Aside from the rockets, every damage item I pick up damages him through his shields. The second is having a Glowing Meteorite for his second phase; the worms have hitboxes on every part of their body and they can be hit individually, so this item does massive damage to them and has the potential to oneshot them.",

But religious faith is strengthened by community and social support. If you live 10 miles from your nearest neighbor, you're more likely to send them a letter than lean over your fence to have a conversation. So while a farmer may favor lower taxes, limited government, and generally libertarian values, his religious views are probably informed more by his sources of information (TV, Internet, radio, other media) than his interaction with his community. Especially with modern communication, the idea that one must belong to a church to be an upstanding member of society has fallen away. And there's much more competition for faithful members, as individuals are no longer limited to the building within driving range of their home. So if your local pastor happens to support increased federal grazing fees, it's much easier to leave that group and find another that more closely mirrors your own beliefs. This has the double-sided effect of making specific group members more adamant in their belief, and also reducing the wider appeal of each individual church. As a result, you see opposing churches cannibalizing each other in a desperate attempt to steal members, while in the process turning off more and more people to the idea that faith is a necessary component of life.",

I mean if you are really looking for the traditional approach you might have to move on to somewhere else.

Honestly from reading your post, you sound like someone who will find more about the faith and learn over time through some great internet sources (fisheaters (the website, not the forum), catholic encylcopedia etc). I really wouldn't worry too much about the formation. In my six years as a Catholic I've learned that the Catholic Church and even just the Latin Rite is a much larger place that I realized.

My sister would end up falling asleep on the couch while I watched because she didn't want to go upstairs alone after all the lights in the house were out. So one Saturday night, my parents were out, I played video games and caught the second run of adult swim. It was maybe 3 in the morning when I finally decided to hit the hay. My sister, as usual, was fast asleep on the couch. I woke her up and told her I was going upstairs. Groggily, she stood and shuffled her feet behind me to the stairs. I got halfway up when she said behind me, \"Come on!\" She was staring into the pitch black dining room, hands on her hips. I told her I was in front of her, and she looked at me and shook her head. \"Not you! The little girl!\" She pointed into the dark nothingness. I am scaredy cat. Our house was also quite old and my sister had a history of, shall we say, strange happenings in this place. So naturally, I felt my blood turn cold and my mind instantly flipped to \"holy shit, she's talking to a ghost\" mode. I grabbed her hand and yanked her up the stairs as fast as possible. She sat down on her bed and was about to fall asleep. OH, NO, NO. Not before I had an explanation! \"Who were you talking to down there?\" I asked, shaking her awake. \"The little girl!\" she said (very grumpy.) \"Who?!

    "input_text": "Not only is there competition between potential mates there is inter-sexual competition as well. Actually, competition isn't even accurate. It's more like an arms race. There are some species who have penis' that flange out barbs (like an arrowhead) during intercourse making it impossible to remove until the male ejaculates. Females of such species have evolved false vaginas so that they have a certain degree of control over who they are impregnated by. I.e. if/when they are being raped by an undesirable male, they will guide the rapist's penis into a canal that does not lead to the cervix where the sperm will just die off. A desirable mate's penis will be guided to the actual cervix. It's not even over once the female is impregnated. In fact, it gets even crazier. The incentives for evolution have some weird side-effects. For example, it's to the male's advantage to promote gestational growth even at the expense of the mother, (Because as long as the child lives and your genes are transmitted who cares if the mother dies? You can always impregnate another female) so there are certain genes promoted by males to hasten fetal development. Obviously this is NOT to the female's advantage as dying severely hampers their own ability to transmit genetic material so the female versions of these same genes delay fetal development. This has severe ramifications if one side is knocked out due to a random mutation. If the female genes are knocked out, the male genes act unopposed and you get angelman's syndrome. If the male genes are knocked out you get Prader-willie syndrome. You can also see the effects of this inter-gender arms race when an egg without genetic material is fertilized by a sperm anyway. In this case the male DNA replicates to form 46 chromosomes instead of the regular 23 from the dad and 23 from the mom. The unopposed male genes promoting gestational growth and development with no regard for the mother's life becomes [malignant](",

So in June, he moved out here, and things have been downhill ever since, fighting (verbally) all the time.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, since the birth of our daughter, things have not improved between us.

I would be inclined to keep trying and/or seek counseling, but he is simply no longer interested in nor sexually attracted to me. It's a tough pill to swallow, and I am increasingly more unhappy cohabitating with him, especially given the way he feels. He spends several hours a day playing video games and surfing the internet, while I am juggling breastfeeding, diapering and mealmaking. I want to move back to my old place (which I own), but he says that while I am free to go, our daughter must stay with him. She is only 3 months, and I would like to continue breastfeeding her for at least a year, but it is so emotionally draining to be around her father--I still love him, and it just hurts to be around his indifference toward me, especially in the face of his love of our daughter.

All in all, these seem to be more of an \"Opinion of popular trend\" chart, a sort of 'popularity tier list'. Without a doubt the characters on the Top of the list are quite powerful, but these things start to form a bit of stagnation in lower skilled summoners - reinforces the idea that picking characters in the lower part of the chart can be threatening to the performance of a team. >So I find this list MUCH harder to put champions into tiers without being a bit biased.

I figure this will be fixed in service of useful blueprints/ updates to copy/paste system, but I thought I might mention it incase. Slave cockpit (sounds weird)/wireless control- I mean that it would be great if an attached piece would recognise the movement of the master-piece (object with cockpit in use/main cockpit if it could be designated) so that a) the child object does not resist the force of the parent object (sounds weird) when it's trying to move. Also B) so that the engines on the child piece could contribute to the movement. This could function by having the orientation of the master cockpit determine the direction of engines (the same way as in a single ship), when the motor changes position, the force of an engine is redirected. So that I don't have to make an additional post, motor-non related suggestions; -Rudimentary programming, something like Macros would be great.

But I have one brother, Gordon, who, thanks to the internet and male friends, has become a hardcore \"meninist\", and very sexist. For example, today I mentioned to my mom that I wouldn't feel comfortable delivering pizza late at night, especially considering I'm a girl. (It was just a passing remark) My brother blew up. He said \"why does it matter that you're a girl? Why should all guys feel safe?\" I said they shouldn't necessarily, but being outside late at night is more dangerous and uncomfortable for girls because of rape and sexual harassment. I tried to explain that guys could also be uncomfortable but, personally, FOR ME, being female would factor in to why I wouldn't like a job delivering pizza at night. My brother started swearing and yelling at me. He said \"why the fuck are you blaming all men for something not even a lot of people do? What the fuck? You've never even been raped, you have no idea how it feels unless you've been raped, which you haven't so you can't talk about this. I should he just as uncomfortable being a man as you are a woman. Being a woman doesn't give you an excuse to act like a fucking coward and be paranoid all the time for no good reason. You just think every man on the street's gonna rape you!\" I was flabbergasted!!! This happens a lot but never this... Bad. He also mentioned how women lie about rape all the time and that \"99% of rape cases are lies\" (ok sure....)

I ditched those all quickly and switched over to Depo. Over about seven years on Depo I had gained thirty pounds, slowly became depressed, and completely lost my sex drive.

Well, I had to squint at the video for a while (around 7:00), but I managed to convince myself that when the disc warps, it moves the individual bits of the disc closer to the axis of rotation (it reduces the moment-arm of each dV of disc), and thus lowers the rotational energy.

I have a 150000 BTU force air furnace and I have in the floor radiant heat that I installed when we ripped up all the carpet and tiled the whole ranch. The major difference is my in the floor heat is also natural gas. Now please don't laugh at the next part my fellow techs; my in the floor heat is not a boiler, but rather a 60000 BTU water heater (it was installed temporarily until I began work on and completed a snow melt system which would require more BTUs) I live in Michigan (brutally cold winter) and my in the floor heat is all I need to run. That's right, I heat the whole house with a 60000 btu water heater! Most Michigan residences, with force air are paying $200 to $300 in monthly gas bills, my last one was $156. Reason is: Radiant floor heat does not heat the air, which is a poor medium for transferring heat and better suited as an insulator. A forced air furnace \"scorches\" the air and dumps it into the space, it then rises to the top. 85% of heat loss in a house is through the ceiling. The builders did the right thing by installing a 150000 BTU furnace in a 1950 sq ft house because the design requires a lot more BTUs when you are trying to heat with air. I can get away with 60000 in the floor because now the floor becomes a thermal mass radiating heat into all the furniture and people in the house, while the cool air acts as an insulator, adding one more barrier to heat loss.",

Cutting is very addicting, and it seems as if you are relying on self harm do regulate your emotions. If cutting helps your stress, then that is a positive use for it. However, your stress should not bring along an undeniable /need/ to cut. When something like this stops becoming a choice, something is wrong.",

However, the post expresses concern over the user's apparent reliance on self-harm to regulate emotions, suggesting this could be indicative of an addiction and a potentially unhealthy coping mechanism.

If squads want to go behind lines and actually fight there to distract defenders, they're free to do that. The mechanics still allow it.

My theory is that their pact that began so long ago (bravo and thief) is still very much alive, to a deeper degree than most realize. Illyrio clearly supports Daenerys, having lent her his support in sending Barristan and then Tyrion her way. It is also worth noting that he originally supported Viserys and hoped he would succeed, not having considered Daenerys even a contender until her \"rebirth\". Varys more clearly supports Aegon, having allegedly made the baby swap that saved his life in infancy. Now, Varys was a part of the plot to help assassinate Daenerys. He had to carry out his orders, lest he be seen as false. He may have sent warning to Jorah Mormont or Illyrio, but all the same he saw to the plans, knowing full well that she may die. I believe Varys is a Targaryen loyalist. There was a passage in an AFFC Jaime chapter: \"When this battle is done, I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago but... Well it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when we return.\" Rhaegar says that to Jaime. I believe the council is to the point of removing Aerys from power, and I believe Varys was part of the plan, most likely a central motivator for it. Targaryen loyalist or not, he likely knew that they wouldn't remain in power long with the Mad King at the head of the Kingdoms. Illyrio and Varys having both Daenerys and Aegon to support and bank on effectively doubles their chances of seeing a Targaryen restored to the throne--and in their support it would gain them high honors.",

In the real world however, we do not need such complicated things. Hold up a heavy rock with a stick then put some bait under it. With a little luck, you'll catch yourself a small critter for dinner. This is my first suggestion. A stone(any kind really) on top of a stick (like an upside down lever) would make a Deadfall Trap. These traps would be placed on the ground, taking up 1 block. You can then right-click this trap with some kind of vegetarian food to bait it. Given some time, the trap will collapse and right clicking it will open a little window where you can grab a piece of meat (if the trap was successful). We don't have to physically add rabbits or squirrels (after all, we don't have fish). And we don't have to alter the effectiveness of these traps in any way. If we wanted to be more complicated, we could add rabbits that would avoid players and wander towards baited traps. Traps don't have to be 100% kill rate, but perhaps a better bait will increase the chance (rabbits love carrots), As well as the number of traps in that chunk. We can restrict the placement of the traps to only areas where the sun shines. There's a lot of technical things we can address about these traps. This is a start. The Deadfall trap would be very easy to make and provide a way to \"farm\" meat. They could be set up faster and earlier than a wheat farm and don't require you to physically chase down animals. The utility of this change of course isn't significant by any means, but boy it would add a nice feeling to the survival aspect of the game. This post is getting long, but my other idea would be a fishing net, made from 9 strings, that could be placed along waterfronts and baited to automatically catch fish. Fish is a good commodity for trading, but is incredibly tedious to get with a fishing rod.",

For the most part, I work with hardware and a lot of end user support, I don't get to do a lot in the way of work in networking, or servers, or really anything else a system admin does. Recently, I have become a contractor for my company (and the IT intern at the same time, I'm splitting my time). My responsibilities at this contracting job are essentially to be the System Admin(for a company of 2-300ish employees). This is a great opportunity for me to learn a lot and look great on my resume for when I finally graduate college. But my problem is, I have no idea what I'm doing . Because I have very little experience with the responsibilities of a System Admin I'm completely lost. When questions pop up I can answer most of them and find most of them online. But my main problem is, I don't know what questions to ask, I don't know where to start, and I don't know what I should know, or try to learn. I do have some great resources at the company I intern for, but I want to try and get as much help as possible. Any advice or tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated! I really just don't know where to start.",

To preface: My friends and I have gone to the beach with one of my friend's family the week of the fourth every summer during highschool. This year was our last year so we decided to put on a big fireworks show on the beach for the fourth. We decide to go all out, and when its all said and done we end up with $868 worth of mortars. And now the fuck up: On the fourth we take all of the fireworks out to the beach for our grand show. we start out by shooting one or two mortars at a time, and quickly progress to four or five at a time. As we shoot off more and more, we start to draw an increasingly larger crowd. At this point I have the genius idea to shoot off nine mortars at a time. What could possibly go wrong? We load all of the tubes, twist the fuses together and I light them up. There are eight simaltaneous expolsions as eight mortars streak into the sky. Unfortunantly the nineth had a longer fuse, and got knocked over by the other eight blasts. It fell pointing straight at the croud of 40 or so people watching. time slowed and I helplessly watched as the mortar shotts straight at the crowd of people, and hits my friend's 8 year old sister as it explodes. There is a deafening boom, flames and fire erupt, and people scream and run. When the smoke clears, we find the girl who got hit. Thankfully she is OK, but our fireworks show is called to a halt and the girl's mother gives me the stink eye the rest of the trip.",

I'm still iffy about it, but with all of this going on I can't help but imagine it. Now let's say that this paranoid thought becomes a reality. Going to the cathedral of learning with one entrance open is going to take I'll say roughly 5 minutes to get inside based on the fact it is the largest building on campus with the highest amount of students that go to class at this time. If you have a line of people waiting to enter this building, this is going to be a shooter's wet dream. If you're going to shoot up a university chances are you don't plan on walking away from this situation alive, so all you need to do is cross the street and unload on the line of people waiting to get inside.

We don't teach children to do math, we teach children to hate math. Not liking it doesn't fucking matter. You need to know multiple ways to solve a problem and think critically, or else you're that smug, useless snot who thinks barfing out their favorite author's opinions on things can change reality if they're presented with statistical data. There is no singular \"problem solving skill.\" You need a few different ways of solving different problems. Not wanting to do math-related topics in college or at work doesn't mean the math skills you were taught in high school. Living in the world isn't a buffet where you pick and choose your life challenges based on which ones you think would be easiest to solve. Plus, through about early high school, pretty much all math is practical. I use the quadratic equation very little in my life, but arithmetic and algebra in particular? Adults absolutely need to know these things. You know all those lottery winners and sports stars who end up going bankrupt almost immediately? They don't go bankrupt just because they're stupid spendy idiots (though I guess if the people criticizing have the same math skills as those bozos, they might interpret it that way), they go bankrupt because the basics of finance (which is math!) aren't something they'd ever been taught or bothered to learn. If you don't understand those basics, that's what happens. It's easy to be taken advantage of, and it's easy to not know what you're doing, when you've always brushed aside anything math related as \"pointless abstract numbers.\" People want to chalk it up to those individuals being particularly stupid or money somehow driving people insane, but it's because those people don't really understand math either.",

I think that the Chelsea youth system as it exists right now is meant to sift through a pool of young, exceptional talent and figure out what few players are of enough quality to contribute to the future of Chelsea's first team. Mancienne/Sala/Tore will probably end up being good, first-team talent at a club somewhere in Europe. That being said, I don't think they will have near the future that players like McEachran and Kakuta will have. So as unfortunate as it is to say goodbye to some quality products from the Chelsea Academy, I have to say that I agree with the youth policy as it has been implemented so far.

She then talked about how she likes me but she had been taken advantage of before because she can be too trusting, so she wants to take things really slow.

A player no longer needs to double up on any item because there are enough items that it's better to diversify your stats. In League, there is always a mathematically \"best\" build path for any given situation. That takes into account the stats you get, how your champion puts them to use, and the gold efficiency of the items you're buying. What this means is that yes, in each role there is a general build that's quite simply the best. This doesn't mean that there's no room for variation depending on the enemy team and their champions (building to counter the enemy team is always wise), but what it does mean is that the builds are always going to look similar. So yes, this means that right now top lane is sunfire and spirit visage, because mathematically these are the best items for those champions right now (though they are being nerfed next patch, so we'll see some diversity soon). This also means that there is an optimal way to build any champion, in any of the lanes you mentioned. I don't think it's correct to say that there aren't enough items, because there are vastly more options than ever before. The issue is that no mater how many items Riot adds or changes, there will always be the items that are the \"best,\" and the rest won't often be built because they're just not the best. No matter if Riot nerfs the strong items or buffs the weak ones or adds new ones altogether, there will always be a specific set of items that provide the best stats in the game for the gold they cost. Finally, the last big item release was not Blade of the Ruined King. They completely revamped support items, adding several new items and build paths.

As a result of this, it made sense for the government itself to compensate the Holocaust victims/survivors directly, and it could be handled (somewhat) efficiently. Conversely, during slavery, slaves were private property, and not in direct control of the government (even though many government officials had their own slaves). Also, slaves were primarily treated like livestock, merely treated as a number on an inventory report in certain cases. This made emancipated slaves harder to keep track of. The fact that the US government did not dictate how the slave owners should treat their slaves is a valid reason for the lack of reparations to slaves and their descendants. The reason the US government has given reparations to Native Americans and those in Japanese internment camps is because those injustices were directly handled (and were sanctioned) by the national government.

Humans, Chimpanzees and many other animals have this. So, I'm taking your question as you wanting to know the advantages of it and why we simply cannot move them independently. First of which is, is that you have an increased field of vision, so you could see more things with one unified form of vision through binocular vision. Also, if you were to hurt one of the eyes, the other eye could serve, more or less, the same purpose. If you were to hurt a squirrel's right eye, you essentially blind the squirrel from knowing anything happening on the right side. For a human, if you were to hurt your right eye, your left eye could see most of the things that the right eye could. The final reason is, is that you have a higher level of perception due to two eyes working for one field of vision. This is related with the higher field of vision. It gives us a sense of a 3D environment. So, our eyes are actually independent muscles but they're controlled by one portion of the brain so it comes together as a unified image. This essentially explains why you can't move them separately... It is because the boss of the eyes, the brain only has one sector which receives and puts together the information. However, there is sort of a glitch to this system. It's called \"Binocular Rivalry\". It is basically, the two eyes being showed two different images and the brain alters which ones it has to listen to and because of various studies, there are many illusions you could do with it. There are various conditions regarding binocular vision failing what it has to do in the manner that it should but that's for another day. I'll recommend you do some of you own research if you want to learn more. This could be done via Wikipedia or Encyclopedia Britannica. cringe I'm not an eye specialist or anything, I used to be quite interested in the topic and asked my",

Instead of a few large news sources, whose views can be skewed and biased and only report on big stories, we have hundreds of thousands of individual investigators searching out relevant news to us. Not that what is going on in the world isn't important, but if we get people interested in the news on a personal level they will be more inclined to absorbing more important stories, and will become more involved in their world. So, in the end, should there be a concerted effort to save the dying news paper industry? Sadly, I feel that it's a medium we should let die. I appreciate it, but it's usefulness is limited as they have to sell more and more ad space, leaving out stories to stay afloat.

When it comes to buying equipment. You really can't live without a good mic. Seriously, a microphone and something that handle the mic's input into your computer. For that, a small little mixer is great since it becomes the center of your music hardware. Here's my suggestion. You can get a small Behringer mixer for about $40 to $50. Something like this . As long as you have a XLR input for a mic on it. You can pick one up second hand for really cheap. For now, grab two RCA -> Jack cables and hook this right into your computer. Then get a nice mic.

I'm a 21 years old male, call me Jack for now, I study Engineering at a highly ranked institute in a middle eastern country, I come from an upper middle class family, I'm agnostic but my family are muslims. There is this girl in class with me, let's call her Anne, so I never really liked Anne or was attracted to her, let me describe her, to me she was never beautiful, she wears a pair of eye glasses and a head scarf you know the one that covers hair and neck. Now I'm not sexy or attractive myself, not at all, I have a lot of issues from Middle and High school, I've never been with a girl, and of course I'm a virgin.

Recently I think I started to develop feelings for her, she's the nicest girl to me, as a friend of course. Now this is how things go in the middle east, you like a girl, you propose to her family, engagement for a while and then marriage, and the best I'll get close to her during that period is holding hands, not even hugs. At this point I'm not sure if I'm starting to like her because I'm horny and miserable or because I love her, the trade off is quite heard, I can't propose to her when I'm not sure of my feelings, that would break her heart later.

So I was waiting for my P.E teacher to arrive and was hanging out by the football field with a bunch of friends.

Relevant information: I was quite athletic back then, and was pretty good at jumping over stuff and climbing stuff. I mean abnormally good (not to brag or anything :P). Anyway, one of my friends says \"Hey, think you can jump over that barrier there?\" I had jumped it many times in many different ways, but there was one way which I was always kind of afraid/knew I couldn't clear, which was to go with no running start, just hop over it.

And the thing is, I ALMOST cleared that, but the tip of my left foot hit the barrier, I lost my balance and crashed hard on the ground below, elbows first. At first I didn't really realize what had happened then I looked at my left elbow (which was completely and utterly disfigured) and I just thought \"Well shit...\" It didn't even hurt that bad, believe it or not.

Its a LOT of money to push into the open market directly without oversight. While I am sure at the outset there would be regulation you have to take the long-view which, in my mind, shows that markets naturally de-regulate over time.

In a given year, if you make more then some # you are mandated to self-invest in some regulated fund. If you make less welcome to SS! But basically kick the rich folks out of the system (while still asking them to fund some of it). That reduces the overall cost, removes the ponzi nature of it (we are not promising it to everyone, its a tax on the wealthy to support the poor) and it would naturally adjust as someone moves through the ups and downs of life.

I see the jumping puzzle as like a different kind of keep, something that holds value and might be worth protecting from other servers. A) You can deny quite a few blueprints. B) If you have it set up, you should only need a group of 5-7 to keep off a horde of enemies, meaning that if they are down here in the puzzle, you have numbers advantage on the overworld. Another thing worth noting is that mesmers are AMAZING in this situation for two reasons, portals and walls . The portal skill is amazing in the hands of a mesmer who is decent at the jumping puzzle because there are so many areas where a mesmer can portal all lagging behind up to speed, and there's also a part where above the pit you can actually portal people all the way from the beginning to the top. Then there is the wall that the mesmer has, it has a 900 range and a 300~ pull towards the center of the wall when you close it. I have yanked off SO many people that are in front of me with it, it just isn't funny.

I don't think there's anything unethical about the masturbatory act in itself- it's simply satisfying a physiological desire that every living organism has. That being said, pornography itself has it's own ethical and interpersonal repercussions. Besides what Grizzleyt pointed out, I think it has an anti-social and voyeuristic aspect which could be unhealthy if indulged in to an extreme. I.e., the sexual impulse is a drive for social interaction and even self-improvement. When the libido is completely mitigated through masturbation and pornography, there is little or no desire to satysfy those needs in a social context- however, I think the over-saturation of porn in our culture is a symptom of anti-social behavior and not a cause. The reason masturbation is derogative in an artistic or intellectual context is that these are supposed to be productive pursuits, with a goal of expanding ones emotional or mental capacities.

I had stalled for about 3-4 weeks, I chalked it up to gaining some muscle at first because I had just started lifting, but then I got a hernia (unrelated) and was still stalled, then I thought it was due to lack of exercise as I had been cycling 3-4 times per week and had to stop due to the injury. I believe now, that it was due to a protein shake I was using as breakfast every morning. It is a good shake, and I will probably continue on it once I'm down a bit more and I get this damn hernia fixed, but in the meantime, I lost 10 more lbs in the last couple weeks after discontinuing the shakes! The shakes are only ~7g net carbs, and 20g protein and I was adding coconut and mct oils but I think it was the culprit. NSV: I also gained a whole wardrobe that was in storage, down from XXXL to XXL shirts and 48 to 44 pants. The question(s): Has anyone just felt generally wierd for a while after starting this diet? I've had anxiety issues for years, so every little thing causes me to think I'm dying, so to speak. Just curious if its common, certainly won't stop me until something actually happens. I'm due for some blood work soon, so that should help me relax a bit. Does anyone float around the 50-100 carb range or is that too high.

In attempts to prevent lane players from taking jungle camps, Riot took base gold away from each camp and gave the jungle item Machete an equal amount of gold bonus to compensate. This change will not affect most junglers, but does affect the Fiddlesticks jungle early game, as Fiddlesticks jungle does not rely on auto attacks to clear camps, and therefore does not start with Machete. While this initial change does not kill the Fiddlesticks jungle completely, the pattern established to prevent laners from taking a jungle by transferring jungle rewards to revolve around the Machete item will further nerf Fiddlesticks jungle. Currently on the PBE they are experimenting with further buffing the jungle, but making the machete stronger.

[Trade Winds]( and the [Coriolis effect]( If you look at the Jet stream, which is the strongest and most powerful movement of air in the world, you notice it all circulates west to east for the most part; so how is it that storm systems in the Atlantic move in the opposite direction of this massive force? You must first understand how trade winds work; they usually work independent of the stream systems, although that doesn't mean they're not effected. Trade winds are often powered by what are called [Hadley Cell]( circulations. In equator and tropical regions the basic rise and fall of the air fueled by warm water and cool air, will create winds that move in particular directions. Now take the warm tropical zone of the Atlantic, where you have vast amounts of rising and falling air and take that together with the Coriolis effect; which due to the particular rotation of the earth, means falling air once it hits the earth will be pushed in a West to Northwest fashion; once this air is far enough north, the Coriolis effect has far less power, and the Northernly Jet stream starts to catch the wind, so it will move more north, eventually moving NE/East; by this point a storm sytem is usually in Norther New England, or dead in the middle of the Bible belt.",

I get a lot of a green apple like taste on the inhale and on the exhale I get a lot of the sweet and cinnamon crust like flavor. Sweet Peach Treat: 5/5 I get an almost sweet peach iced tea flavor. I also get a hint of cinnamon on the exhale. The peach is very prominent and is a very satisfying vape. Has very good ADV potential for me.

It felt like this episode literally had no coherent narrative, just a lot of pieces that COULD have been a narrative. The vibe I get is that this one was supposed to be an adventure story: great. So it's a D&D setup: you go in, explore, have escalating conflicts and then resolve into some kind of victory (or everyone dies, but obviously that wasn't going to happen). Here, nothing was fought, and nothing was gained. There was no significant obstacle to overcome, either living foe or environmental. Twilight got no information on the box (books, but that doesn't count). And the others each had mini-stories that sort of resolved, but you can't do justice to 4+ overlapping stories in 20 minutes, so they all fall flat. And honestly, they sucked anyway. Rarity exploring a castle to restore fabric isn't an adventure, just a lead-in. It's a reason to get her there, but then something else has to happen, and nothing significant does. Same with the others. Again, though, I'll certainly admit that at least this episode didn't reek of awful, and actually did have some charming moments. I was excited when Twi found the library in the beginning. And then she literally spent almost all of the rest of the episode doing nothing. That's the problem in a nutshell.

I clicked on the 'purchase' button as a joke, knowing there needed to be a second screen before the transaction went through.

For a long time I struggled with whether something was wrong with me or if the rest of these people were crazy for believing in their magic sky man. I was probably around 10 years old when I finally asked my mother if she believed in god or an afterlife, she thought a moment and said \"No, but it's a nice idea. Everything my life has shown me tells me that God isn't real and that when we die we just die, but wouldn't it be great if there was something after? I just can't count on it, so I try to be good now, and be good to the people that I love and tell them everyday.\" She then took me out for ice cream. I paraphrased exactly what she said, but that was the meat of it, and the part of the ice cream is true. Since that day I've had a rational, reality based view of the world and I have never looked back.",

So we chat for a minute, we give him some tuna to show we're \"friendly\" and we get talking. I head off to get some pond water for our friend to drink, after force-feeding him a rotten kiwi. Sadly, there was none to be found, so I gave him some legit water and a bottle. Maybe you see where this is going now; first some food, then some water and a bottle... Well, anyhow, some other new spawn came upon us and started just beating the crap out of my buddy - who was valiantly trying to fend him off with a can opener! - and our red-shirted friend came to our aid and tried to punch the guy out.

Most teachers show up to school before class starts to either prepare for the day, be available to students, or to do some bullshit with busing or extracurriculuar stuff. They will usually stay well PAST 2pm on most days to get organized, set up things for the next day, be available to students some more, host/coach things, attend meetings, etc. Then when they get home, they have to grade papers. That's a part of the job too and it doesn't just happen while your kids take tests. I'd guess most teachers see about 70-100 students each day and every homework assignment/quiz/test/essay/whatever has to be graded for all of them. You can't do that just in class, you take that shit home. You stay up late, put in grades, comment on papers, and then you do it all again the next day. Summers are NOT June to September. A lot of teachers will still be going in to school for a week or two after the kids finish. And a lot of them are required to be in school about a week before school starts, and a lot will go in a week or so before that. Is there more \"time off\" for longer vacations? Maybe, depending on where you work. But it isn't a 7-2 job if you're doing it right. There's extra hours everyday that cut into all that \"free time\" people talk about teachers' having.

Once the group has decided the disc has come to rest, the player has holed out. Several target related terms have been officially defined and added to the Definitions section 800 in support of the Holing Out rule. Definitions for Basket Target, Tray, Chains, Chain Support and Pole have been added. Groups will now be responsible to make judgment calls on how discs enter the basket. Discs that attempt to enter or actually get all the way into the chains or basket thru the top of the chain support or thru the side or bottom of the basket now will not count if the group or official sees that happen. This means wedgies, most which wedge from the outside, now will not count unless it was a blind shot where no one saw how the disc wedged. Putts that are observed to properly enter the basket from above the rim and then wedge trying to get out will count as holed out like before. These changes for holing out mean calls for the \u201cputting tree\u201d photo shown below that was in the Rules School story on Interference need to be updated. Under the old rules, only the yellow disc would not have been considered holed out when the player removed it. Under 2011 rules, the white and red discs are holed out (IN). The yellow disc as before and the orange disc hanging on the nub outside the basket are NOT IN. The orange disc balancing on the rim, which used to be considered IN, is now considered OUT in the 2011 rules because the disc is not entirely supported by the pole, inner wall or bottom of the basket. The orange wedgie is now NOT IN if the group observed it wedge from the outside. If the group did not see it or watched it clear the top basket wire then wedge on the way out, it is IN.",

He pulls up along side of us and says \"Get in the car, these guys are going to rob you.\" It look around me and it suddenly all clicks as to what is happening.

Sometimes a new cocktail of psychotropics will cover the hole for a little while, but it is always there waiting for the latest barrier to fail. A little context, I have suffered 3 career-related breakdowns in the last 5 years that have left me terrified of finding work and paralyzed with the shame of not working. I am a grown man with a Master's degree and I have a wife and two children. I am also a veteran...not a combat veteran though. I have been diagnosed with MDD, Panic Disorder and GAD. I have also had moderate but chronic health problems since my late twenties that exacerbate the mental health issues. Also admittedly occasional bouts of abuse of prescription drugs and alcohol. I have been with my current partner for almost 8 years and she has struggled with her own issues such as no shit clinically diagnosed OCD.

I think lately the thing is getting annoyed with my lack of attention and has now started to look for attention elsewhere from guest. My roommate has a girlfriend and she is a sweetheart. She knows about the house creep, but seems to be okay with it. She can hear it stomp down the hallway, has had doors closed in her face, seen the lights flicker. She knows it's there, but tries to ignore it like the rest of us. Luckily for her, the creepy stuff tends to happen in my room (I.e. Likes to turn on the xbox when I get out of the shower. I think this thing has seen too many cheesey horror movies) Well last weekend, the boyfriend and I decided to go hiking, one roommates was at work, and her boyfriend was out of town. They had a late night the night before and his family had picked him up early in the morning for a Mother's Day weekend. He had given her his key, that way she could leave, but yet still sleep in. She wakes up while everyone is gone and when she comes out of the room, she sees my bedroom light is on and heard noises coming out of my bedroom. She then sees an arm come out and slam my bedroom door shut. It has freaked her out so much that she refuses to come back to the house. I don't know what to do. I want people to be inside my house, but I don't want whatever is there to scare them away. At this point I'm feeling like I need to call the priest, or god damn ghost busters. I don't know if I need advice or if I need to vent. I don't know why the house is so god damn creepy cause it wasn't built incredibly long ago.

    "input_text": "I keep seeing people repeat how EB/MoM is much worse than hybrid because it makes your ES function at only 30% effectiveness. This is wrong and I wanted to clear this misconception up. Warning: Math. The actual effectiveness of your ES with EB/MoM is really just a function of the ratio of your max ES to your max Life. I'll just define R = Max ES/Max Life for simplicity. Since 30% of damage goes to ES and 70% to life, as long as R<.3/.7 or about 43%, all of your ES will be used up before your life goes to 0, which means your ES is still 100% effective. If R>.43, the ES damage you take before life is reduced to 0 is .43*Max Life. Which means your ES Effectiveness % is .43/R. A better way to think of it might be, your ES is 100% effective up until 43% of your max life. After that, it is 0% effective. So for example, if you have 4k life, ES is 100% effective up to 1720. There are a few other considerations which are also important if we're comparing Hybrid ES/Life with EB/MoM. Con: EB/MoM takes a number of passive points to pull off. You probably also want Ghost Reaver or Zealot's Oath. Con: Your ES won't be 100% effective unless it's relatively small. However, it's usually going to be much better than the 30% people often say. Pro: Extra herald/aura. Pro: You can start using pots immediately after taking damage because you will have life to refill. Hybrid can't pot until losing all ES. I don't know whether or not EB/MoM is better than hybrid (or straight ES or Life), but I think it'll be better than many are giving it credit for.",

In the trophy range that I started the experiment (1100-1200) people are dumb. I had the majority of people dropping troops outside the south side of the base, without dropping a single troop among the collectors. Another favorite raid strategy was exemplified by someone dropping 30 gobs in the collectors, then dropping 100 barbs on the southside, and once all those troops were dead, dropping another 30 gobs to try and run the gauntlet to try and kill the 2 (empty) collectors inside the base. Watching 30 gobs try to run between 2 wiz towers is hilarious. People were not trying to raid for resources, but when the tried to raid for trophies, most of them failed too. When I dropped to lower trophy levels (800-900), I had better success, people obliged by dropping a couple of troops and then leaving, however, I didn't get that many takers. I usually had around 100K+ in each of my storages, so they could have gotten an easy 25-50K+, but most did not bite. I think even in the lower trophies, people just keep hitting next and will only look at a base if there are a lot of resources for the taking. I even tried putting a giant arrow made of walls next to my townhall pointing towards the loot, but people still skipped me a lot. Since finishing my TH7 upgrade I rearranged my base into a new configuration and even though I still only have th6 defenses (level 2 cannons and archer towers make a base worse, not better), I won more battles in 24hrs [with my new base]( then in 48hrs with the gem farm.",

Both times the piercing was performed by an APP member. First time, I was a little less knowledgeable, but I knew I needed a good piercer and good jewelry. Was pierced at an 18g with a neometal labret. The initial bar was longer for swelling, and the cab was 3mm. Had a pretty decent initial healing period (looking back, I did a good job with the aftercare despite being inexperienced with oral piercings), but things went south around the three month mark. My lip was NOT having it. Pain, swelling, extra tissue, lymph, lip trying to swallow the disc . It was awful. Every so often, with a lot of TLC, it would calm down for a week or so. But that would mean I had to be extremely careful about what I ate and how I used my lips with my husband. It wasn't fun, and it always ended up being pissy again. Here shows the reoccurring problem. Retired it. Waited 6-8ish weeks. Had been loyal to another APP member at this point, and visited him for the repierce. I requested a 12g anatometal labret because I had theories about the 18g being \"too thin\" and possibly migrating and maybe a 12g post would shut my lip up. Wrong. So wrong. It was pierced beautifully. There was no wonky angle, it sat flat against my teeth, and it felt sturdy as fuck. Within four weeks, I was back to having a seriously pissed off philtrum. This time the swelling was much worse, and I worked an entire shift where one side of my upper lip was completely balloon-like. Retired because I missed eating curry and kissing my husband. SO...my question is...is my immune system simply against oral piercings, or do I have a shot at healing a vertical labret/center labret/inverse vertical labret in my future? I would love to hear your stories if you have them. Thanks!",

Since you're getting the erection at the same time every day, it may be tied to a other parts of your daily ritual, like what you ate for breakfast or an increased blood pressure from a long walk across campus, or just from a natural ebb and flow related to the time you wake up on the days you have accounting class. Alternatively, you might have something called a 'fetish' related to a particular sight, sound, or smell present in the environment of your accounting class. A fetish is when your brain sexualizes something that isn't necessarily sexual. For example, some people have latex fetishes, so the particular feeling of that material on their skin causes pathways in the brain related to sexual arousal to activate and cause happy sexual feelings. Although why people have fetishes is unknown, popular theories suggest that when a person, especially biological males, are young, the parts of their brain that allow for awareness of sexuality 'turn on' at some point. This is probably a gradual process, so that as connections making it possible to get aroused start forming around genitalia or sexual acts, sometimes something about the smell of accounting textbooks or the sound of a person erasing a chalkboard get accidentally wired into the sexy sex circuiting as these connections form. Maybe a person has a hormonally produced erection for the first time while hiding under a table looking at bare feet.

Startled, i almost drop the cup. I quickly take another cup and up the ante. A tank of hydrogen peroxide was now ready to take take on the invincible arthropod. I carefully skim the alcohol out of the cup and dump the spider into the new cup. He fizzes as he tumbles into his new hell. Gradually, the foam clears from the surface to reveal the undoubtedly living spider under the surface. Again i pour the liquid down the sink. Now I trap the spider underneath a glob of hand soap. I pick up another two cups, one is filled with scalding hot water, the other filled with cold. I rinse the soap off of my victim and drop him into the boiling cauldron. Once his squirming had ceased i dump the liquid and deposit the spider into the frigid water. Stunned, he is hurled into the porcelain throne. I unzip my jeans and unleash a golden river onto the battered arachnid. I then turn around, drop my pants and release a hearty log on top the soiled bug.

I figured his sex life was his business. Mama goes apeshit,throws things at me,screams at me and sort of chases me out of their house. Kid is smug. But her drama and his \"Of course NOT Mom!\" outrage made them tell Dad when he got home.

    "input_text": "I own a consulting business in Texas). As of early last year when I had an extensive conversation with the Comptrollers office, here is what my understanding, and therefore tax processing situation is: Services are broken into two buckets, taxable and non taxable services. Most \"application development\" falls under the non-taxable services -- however there is a phrase under the data processing services (a taxable service) that specifically mentions web pages. Therefore, the understanding that we came up with was that any time I build a website for a client, it's taxable. If I'm maintaining their website, it's taxable. If I'm doing staff aug (ie my people are there as employee replacements, and they're doing what the client tells them to do) or building an application to the client's specifications, then that is a non-taxable service. Now, things get ugly when you do both taxable services and non-taxable services for a client (say you build a website and you build them an app). The state sees those both then as taxable services. Like I said -- ugly. Now. In your case, I don't have enough details, but if the application is hitting services -- that are not a \"web page/web site\" (ie. just a service, custom code/application for them), then I would not charge them sales tax. However, if you built them an entire web site (marketing, etc.) then, unfortunately, my guess is that the services -- all of them -- would be taxable. Here's where it gets ugly... this portion of the law is very vague and, honestly it's frustrating because you're dealing with people with no understanding of technology and how all this stuff works together. Most staff accountants will be clueless -- especially on the \"data processing - web\" piece of it.",
    "generated_summary": "The user, a consultant in Texas, explains that services can be categorized as taxable or non-taxable. Application development generally falls under non-taxable, but web page development and data processing services are taxable. If the consultant builds a website (including marketing) or maintains one, they are taxable. If they build a custom application or act as staff augmentation, these are non-taxable.

And if we can become even better at this then why not \"intelligence\"?

    "input_text": "Most trainees can put on around 21 pounds of muscle during their first year of lifting with consistently intense training. Does anyone disagree with that number? I know all sorts of numbers get thrown around, but .5lb per week seems to be about right. And if you're going to maximize your gains, you're going to be eating like a mother fucker. So I'll assume a 50% muscle to 50% fat gain we're looking at ~40 pounds of weight gain (20 lb fat, 20 lb muscle)in a year. So I'm going to exaggerate things to make my point here. Say that trainee put on 40 pounds of fat: that would be 140,000 calories of food. Roughly. Very roughly. That's 140,000/365 days giving you a calorie surplus of less than 400 calories a day. Now I know that weight gain (particularly muscle gain!) doesn't work quite that easily, but let's remember that number: +400 calories a day. A diet like the one recommended in this article is going to be a least a two thousand calories above necessary every day. I have never seen a natural trainee (please point me to an exception if you know of one!) eat the way this article is describing and not get horrendously fat. But I get what the article is saying: you shouldn't be afraid to eat. I just have a hard time imagining that someone needs to eat a bowl of peanut butter with chocolate and butter to put on weight. They'd see better results with a few high-fat hamburgers and some potatoes. Most people recommending diets like this got to a very heavy bodyweight (Dave Tate comes to mind!*) eating cleanly before they had to revert to a more extreme approach. * [\"Even with my past history of eating junk, people are forgetting that I gained weight for many years, all the way from 181 to 255 pounds, by eating relatively clean. But at that point, when the calories were getting around 8,000, I just couldn't eat that much food any more.\"](",

With a pen you can simply inject in a different spot, but with a pump you need to insert a new infusion which isn't always an easy thing to do (I was at school in this case) The day started out fine, woke up with 4.8 and had my usual breakfast. When I measured my BG two hours later it was at 13.7. No big deal, just bolus a bit and wait it out. My BG quickly rised to 16.7 at lunchtime and 20.5 just an hour later. After a lot of aggressive bolussing, I got it down to 13.8 by 4:30 and decided to go home for the day. At home my BG was 3.4! I didn't bolus for dinner and still ended up at 2.2 two hours later. Fast forward four hours of measuring every 15 minutes and eating/drinking constantly while floating between 2.0 and 7.0 all the time (might I add I didn't have any insulin since my 4:30 bolus and even turned off the basal rate before dinner). I think I've drank a good two liters of apple juice, ate two bananas, five sandwiches, had dinner, ate 7 granola bars and threw up twice in the past four hours.

I did not do any research regarding whether or not this topic has been posted before, but I haven't seen it in my year or so of redditing. Being as the person who introduced me to LoL was a competitive scene fangay, I got introduced to the wonderful scene of LCS. I have loved every second (literally, every second. With the exception of 4 games I missed due to a hospital visit for my Mother - yes I watched the VODs, Mom's fine too.) Today, I was doing some thinking regarding the amount of time game's last and the point at which games reach where CS becomes unimportant. I think a simple item to implement would be one that gains stacks based on CS. This would not only buff champions that are currently out of meta by adding a late-game extension to their power, but also adding the idea of champions that do well farming lane, a buff (Yes, nasus would require nerfs - Sorry Cane). I understand the counter arguement that making the games longer isn't feasible due to LCS taking too long, though I feel that is a necessary change for a MOBA that wants to expand into the most strategic game possible, I do not believe it would lengthen the game too much due to the small size of the map. It would require a lot of testing, But I am guessing that once champions got maybe 30% stronger then they already become, games would end almost definitely after one team fight or one positional mistake (Why shouldn't games go longer if teams can orchestrate it?). Sorry for the horrendous format of this post but I am unaware of how to use it. I googled it, tried to follow instructions, instructions too tanky.

There is a fandom out there combining Merida, Hiccup, Jack Frost (from Rise of the Guardians), Rapunzel (from Tangled), and recently Elsa and Anna (from Frozen), it's all works surprisingly well.

    "input_text": "Simply by playing some normals with some low level friends or on other low elo accounts, I understand the obsession people have with grouping as a team, simply because I have it as well when playing with them. In a higher level play (at least in my experience) people have a greater idea of how different objectives give you advantages, and mostly have a good understanding on when to push for them. For example, as a jungler, if you have any idea of where the enemy jungler is (be it by wards or otherwise), you will either try to counter his gank, or go to the opposite side of the map in order to have a number advantage and get kills or objectives. Same with laners, they'll push and get damage on the turret/gain a CS advantage if they see the enemy laner somewhere else. Whether these \"trades\" are convenient determines the outcome of the game, but you can be sure that your teammates are actively trying to create advantages, and not staying passive while the enemy counterpart gets ahead. However, in a lower level of play, not many people understand the need of constantly pushing for leads. This means that while you are getting 4 man ganked, your team may not retaliate in any kind, some times not even a minor thing like pushing and making the enemy miss a wave. This means that no matter how many enemies you draw to yourself, how much time you make the enemy jungler waste, it will never be worth it simply because they got a kill and your team got nothing. Eventually you lose the trust in your team, and think that the only way for them to be useful is to force them to make plays, and since you can't easily tell them to make complicated strategies, you simply tell them to group so that they'll be around when you go for an objective.",

I absolutely hated high school because of being a twin, felt completely invisible and I've read studies that discuss how twins will try to differentiate themselves from each other simply to be different rather than what actually interests them, which I don't think is a good thing. Constantly getting called by the wrong name and having other people not bother talking to me because they didn't want to call me the wrong name was hard to deal with. Even being in public with my twin was tough because you think everyone is looking at you, everyone is comparing the two of you etc like a circus sideshow. I lost all confidence in high school and it took me a long time to rebuild my life and address social anxiety issues. I've now lived away from my twin for about 10 years in different parts of the world, we don't see each other much but he's still one of my best mates and thanks to the internet we can talk almost everyday. I like to live my own life where I essentially pretend not to be a twin, it might sound harsh but it has made me much happier. I'd suggest to the OP that she pursues the career that she wants to but maybe it would be healthier if she did it in different parts of the country than her twin and made her own group of friends and find out who she is without having to worry about being different to her twin. And I don't think you'll have to worry about being compared with your twin on who is more successful in the chosen career, who is going to do that? Your twin?

Since that breakup, I have to admit that I've been a little scared that I'll never really fall in love again in that perfect \"this feels right\" way. In particular, I have something that frequently happens. Recently I've been seeing a girl that expressed a lot of interest in me. She's kind and funny and pretty fun to hang out with, it's not super serious yet but I enjoy dating her (and the shitty thing to admit, it had been a year since I had had sex and really wanted to break that dry spell). But for some reason I don't feel an intense burning \"I'm in love fire\" with her. Maybe it's that she's not really totally my physical type, which is obviously shallow and really shitty to admit. Maybe it's that there's something about her personality, she's a great and mature and fun person, which makes me fear that maybe I'm only attracted to unhealthy obsessive women who are prone to being overly mellowdramatic and \"you're my world\" into me. Anyway, I'm at kind of a crossroads here, I've been seeing her for a little over a month now twice a week or so, and I'm not sure if I should break it off, or give it more time. On one hand I like being with her and I really enjoy dating her, but I also don't feel like I could genuinely tell her \"I love you\" right now, and I'm not sure if that will change. I'm also worried that I might be wasting her time. A major fault of mine is that I haven't been in a lot of relationships that weren't super serious super quick. All of my relationships have been very serious and emotionally intimate almost instantaneously.",

Other people tried to get in on the joke, and made some crazy claims, like the pyramid on the back of a dollar bill is a sign of the Illuminati, or that the 33 on a Rolling Rock bottle is a sign of the Illuminati. Soon it became that a lot of people believed that members of the Illuminati controlled all the world leaders, others were making up more stories about the Illuminati, and others were saying, \"Illuminati, who?\" So, those who believed that the Illuminati were real, thought they were cool, because they knew something most people didn't.

I told them I don't really like parties and I'd be fine drinking at my house with them or going to see a movie or something. So I told them I was moving a month ago. They knew my last day in town was yesterday and they all stopped by briefly and left when they realized I was just packing up my car. I got an angry message on facebook today about how I totally blew off saying goodbye to them?? Apparently I was expected to plan the whole freaking thing. They thought they were just going to show up without even confirming I was doing stuff and they expected me to have beers and weed and shit for them to do?? Like I'm busy MOVING I don't have time to party plan too. On top of that, two of the friends had taken over my lease and they're mad because they don't have internet right now... Because I cancelled MY internet subscription... They've had more than a month to get their shit sorted out and somehow it's my fault now? I know this all sounds bad but these guys are actually really nice most of the time, they're all just kind of dumb about how to be adults and they've always looked to me as being the mom of the group.

How do I convey to them it upsets me that they didn't put in any effort to do anything? I don't really care that I didn't have a party but they didn't even bother to stick around till I was leaving and it really hurt my feelings, like they were just looking for an excuse to party or something.

Tom and I have been friends for a little over a year and we get along great. We met through a mutual involvment and hit it off right away. Last year, I was a freshman in college and he was a junior. We both lived in the dorms. He lived across campus and spent a lot of time in my dorm. After a while, he began actually sleeping on our futon. My roommate didn't really have a problem with his staying all the time because we all got along. Well, this progressed into EVERY NIGHT and became very obnoxious. It wouldnt have been near as bad if he had showered or kept any kind of heigene in the process. He smelled. Horribly and so did our dorm room. We did everything we could to keep fresh air circulating when he wasnt around. Neither of us actually had the courage to confront him about it. Eventually, school ended and we thought that may be the end of that. Fast forward to this year. My roommate and three other friends moved into a house together. Tom wasn't really in the conversation because he had already signed a lease with other friends. The year began normally and Tom ended up coming over quite a bit. His smell was still excruciating but we pushed through it. Until... Christmas break. My roommate, Harry, from last year, Tom, and I decided to take a road trip to Vegas. So, we hop in the car and go. HORRIBLE DECISION. The smell was terrifying in the car. And the hotel. As soon as we got back to school, he began spending the night every night. Our living room began smelling and we couldn't get him to leave. He literally would not leave our house. If he did it was only for a short while and then he was back without even telling us.

Last I've read PCIE3 does 75w or something from the mobo slot. If you have a setup, such as when cramming video cards into 1x slots or more video cards than you have 16x slots for, you'll want to use a powered riser. Whether or not your setup causes some kind of meltdown depends on the quality of the motherboard. If you use an unpowered riser cable, and get into a situation where your PCI-E cards are pulling too much power through the Mobo, a good mobo might be fine and limit the amount of power being drawn. Other ones might not care and end up having their connectors melt, hence the pictures. I have a mobo that can handle 3x GPU's. Had to bring the middle card out with a riser due to cooling issues. As soon as the riser comes into the picture the card has voltage issues and causes hard reboots.

They had a \"Camp Meeting\" every summer, basically everyone lived in tents or cabins and was supposed to go to religious meetings all day for a week. When I was 16, I was hanging out with a friend who was from the area in which the Camp Meeting was held. We took off without me telling my mother I was leaving and walked a few miles to my friend's house. Along the way we got cigarettes, which of course was highly forbidden by the church. We hung out at his place for a while and then headed back toward the camp area, but along the way he decided we needed to get drunk. So we found someone who would buy some booze for two obviously underage guys and ended up with a pint of really bad Canadian whiskey, which we consumed quickly (first time I'd ever had alcohol) and without having eaten anything recently. Needless to say, severe drunkenness ensued. Hours passed, which included a miserably failed attempt at hooking up with girls, vomiting in a house under construction, vomiting in the back of a random car, passing out, etc. By now it's about 4:00 AM and I've been gone from the camp for nearly 24 hours with my parents having no idea where I was. So we finally stagger our way back into the camp, obviously drunk, me throwing up in every trash can we passed, and the first person we encounter is...my mother.

Second: My thought on this manner is, take the deal. Vanek is in a contract year. He is Buffalo's star player, but they are looking to trade him. It sounds like Buffalo is preparing a firesale, as the rumors are swirling that Miller and Vanek will be gone before the season's end. Not only will Vanek be playing for a new contract, he will also be playing to impress team's into trading for him. The rumor I'm hearing is that he wants to come play for Minnesota (I REALLY hope so!!). This would likely put him on a line with Koivu and Parise, unless they put him on the second line with Zucker and Pominville. Either way, this looks to be a huge year for Vanek. Assuming you are NOT in a keeper league, I say take Vanek. HOWEVER, if you are in a keeper league, I say you should hold on to Eberle.

I'm a 22 year old senior male in college, I stand at about 6 foot 2 inches and weigh roughly 245 pounds, I've been hitting the gym lately to fix that problem. I'm generally very quiet and work focused at school but am outgoing when people engage me or in the classroom. My situation is this, I've been seeing a lot of strange body language and behavior from women lately. I've noticed that particular women will go out of their way to avoid me. I've never spoken to any of these women--though one of them is acquainted with my older sister and another is heavily involved in my degree program--I see them often, just by being around the school. Here are a few example situations: About a week ago, one of these women seemed to follow me into the printing room, saw that I was preoccupied, and proceeded to pass me, turn her back, and stare at a blank bulletin board for what seemed like an eternity. The second situation, this time with a different girl, seemed to be a clear case of avoidence of initimidation. I was sitting at a computer in the library and turned to look at the noise down the hall. I made eye contact with the young lady and what followed was a hilariously unsubtle change in direction. She literally turned on her heel and went through the printing room to the adjacent hallway. Mind you, the way our library is set up, both hallways lead to the same destination. A similar situation happened with a third woman just the other day. It's been bothering me, because it's mostly behavior just coming from these three. Are they afraid of me, or physically intimidated or something? I make a point to mind my posture and I make a lot of eye contact with people in general. And from what I know of the first girl, she isn't exactly shy.",

So my craft project is basically I have a small glass bottle that's topped with a cork, it's basically the size of a necklace charm. Inside the bottle, my idea was to have two different liquids so that one would float on top of the other, and that they'd separate heterogeneously when settled. Think kinda like a lava lamp, but not necessarily in constant flux. So far, I've been using water based ink (marker ink + water to get the hue I want) and acrylic paint. This has been working out decently so far but, after being allowed to settle for a couple of weeks, I've noticed that the clear-ish liquid from the acrylic paint separates out slowly. This isn't a big deal, as shaking the bottle corrects this, for the most part. However, after several months I've noticed that the acrylic also gums up and gets more and more solid over time. Silly me, I thought acrylic was oil based, but I've recently been made aware that it's more like a plastic/polymer. This is fine though, as I've already decided that I wanted to use another liquid for the oil-based component anyway. As for what said replacement should be, the only substance I've been able to think of has been to use oil based food colouring to dye baby oil or some such clear oil. Is there any better way to go about this?? The only criteria is that whatever I'm using should be readily available in a store (general, art, hardware, etc) and found without too much difficulty (but hopefully also not too expensive). Thanks in advanced for any tips you guys manage to come up with.",

The brokenness of creation goes deeper than how we act, it goes to the very way we think and feel. God, knowing this even before he gave the law, planned ahead of time to come to earth, obey the law perfectly so that it could be satisfied, then accept the death that everyone else deserved because we do not live up to the standard. By doing this, then overcoming the grave, he accomplished what the law could not do, namely defeat the power of death that destroyed his creation.

Everything went OK (and the doctor didn't give me any \"speeches\", just made sure that I/we were really sure), and I've already passed the \"precautionary\" amount of time, so I should be CF by now.

Once they fell I don't really notice anything anymore, and everything works OK :-D. There is only one thing though, one of the testis is a bit higher than the other.

We also know that he likes to come deep (sometimes very deep), and we also know that he is one of the best creators of chances around.

Does he do this for Uruguay? Admittedly, he does beat two players, but instead of creating an angle for a shot he has the perfect number 9 to lay up for nice tap ins. This defenders all over the place, then comes up with a lovely piece of skill before laying up Cavani with a bread and butter finish. As far as Sturrigde is concerned, he's no Cavani but all he needs to do is look for Suarez, make himself available for a short pass if Suarez is going in behind, or go for the ball in behind if Suarez is deep. Any forward with half a brain really could thrive off Luis after half a season in the same team. To an extent, this season is already (and was always going to be) something of a rebuilding for next season kind of season and so hopefully it won't be a problem to stick them up there together and they can have some time to learn what each other likes to do, which is hopefully combine to score 50 a season.",

For instance, I'm getting married in a church where we paid $400 to reserve it for the ceremony but we get $200 back from our deposit if we leave it in good condition. Most churches aren't out for too much profit ;) And we are using a not fabulous place next to the church for a reception, but we are going to decorate it exactly how we want it with very inexpensive stuff! I went into David's Bridal with a budget in mind for my dress and ended up ordering one that exactly fit the budget (plus tax) at $600... Some people think it's tacky, but if you're not having a huge crowd, it's not so bad to have home made food. Ask a few close family and friends to help out instead of a wedding gift and I'm sure they would be happy to! I wouldn't suggest asking all of your guests, that is considered pretty tacky by most people... One last thing... Invitations may seem inexpensive when you see $1 or $2 or $3 a piece, but when you add it up, it gets pricey! Most of them you will get a discount if you order 100 or more, but imagine paying $300 for invitations! I realized that it's not much cheaper to design your own and print them somewhere than to just order, so I decided to set a budget for that, too. Pretty much the lowest I could find for a good deal was maybe 89 cents per piece, so I decided that I would not pay more than a dollar per invitation, and we found some that we love that are on a great discount for 56 cents a piece if we order a hundred! David's Bridal has some great deals on invitations, so when you look at those I suggest looking there.",

The application randomly unregisters my console at times, occasionally on starting the application and once even while watching something. The application freezes, for me, a lot. Which leads to the next issue: When this application freezes, and you decide to close the app to the home screen, it more often than not just seems to freeze on the home screen load splash making it impossible to shut down the console without pulling the chord completely on the back of the unit. Among other things I've also found inconsistencies in the application that irk me, like how when deciding to return to the home screen in the application there is fucking three ways to do it that all load at different speeds with pressing 'Y' to return being the slowest of them all. Why? I mean, seriously, you can push 'Y', navigate to the tv to the top left of the screen and select the amazon logo, or press the logo on the pad (which also seems to work only on occasion) Like I said, I intend to have a fair or at least balanced approach to this critique, as obviously it's very early in the products lifespan and the application will most likely receive some sort of overhaul, at least in eventuality.

While heading home from a night of partying, we meet three girls and walk the same direction with them for a while. When its time to part, one of them lives further than the rest of us and my friend offers her a ride home. While parked outside her apartment, car off, windows down, he makes a move on her and they start making out. Eventually he starts fingering her since she is wearing a skirt with no panties (this part is irrelevant wink wink) and asks if he can come in. She says no, she told herself she wouldn't do this that night so no, alright no biggie. They continue finger banging. She pins down his hands \"Ooo thats my spot\" moans freely, gets his number and leaves. Cool right? Well, Six months later I get a call from the rape office and a police officer wants to speak with me. It turns out they want my friends information. They drag in my coach right off the bat, instead of contacting me directly. Nice. Now I look like the guy who hangs out with men who are accused of god knows what. Several calls to my friend later and he finds that he is not allowed back at the school. Why? The girl doesn't want to see him there or run into him on campus. There was no rape no charges, just the fact that she went to an office where people deal with actual rape and decided that the boy who made a move on her should never be allowed to visit his friends again and the school backs her up and now my name is on a file and there is documentation of a chubby line backer chick who got finger banged with my name in it. The amount of entitlement and automatic victim placing in this situation is something fiction couldn't come emulate. Thanks America, for making your men second class citizens.

    "input_text": "Here we go 'round the mulberry bush, The mulberry bush, The mulberry bush. Here we go 'round the mulberry bush So early in the morning. There are different variations of the song out there, but most contain stanzas dealing with household chores or personal hygiene (\"This is the way we scrub the floors,\" \"This is the way we wash our face,\" etc). So, we're looking at either a song meant to teach children good household chore practices, or an OCD sufferer's uncharacteristically jaunty list of symptoms. What It Actually Means: Do your chores or the guards will beat you. Former warden R.S. Duncan makes the case that a prison in Wakefield, England, served as the original inspiration for the song. In the mid-1800s, the prison added women to its population, and the theory holds that female inmates would sing the song while they exercised with their children around a central mulberry bush in the prison yard. Man, if they weren't burying them alive, they were locking them away for crimes their mothers committed: Old-timey England sure hated them some children. Throughout its lengthy history, the Wakefield prison had many problems with overcrowding and unsanitary conditions (including outbreaks of cholera and typhoid among the population). As described by one official in 1774: \"This prison is unfortunately built upon low ground; so it is damp and exposed to floods. A prison on ground so low as this requires the utmost attention to cleanliness.\" So yes, those \"brush your hair\" and \"wash your face\" lyrics are pretty quaint, and they teach the kids some good grooming habits, but when you consider that the unspoken implication is \"sweep the floor or you'll die of typhoid,\" it kind of loses a little cuteness, doesn't it?",
    "generated_summary": "The post discusses the origin of the \"Here we go 'round the mulberry bush\" nursery rhyme, suggesting it might have been a song sung by female prisoners in a historic English prison who exercised with their children around a mulberry bush in the yard.

Third was a more creepy one. I would be opening doors to a bathroom, bedroom, house or whatever and there would be someone standing at the door. I never recognized the people in these dreams because they never had a face. The best example I can give you is [this]( .gif.

My power shuts off, but only in my room, the rest of my house is fine but evidently only the breaker in my room decided to go out. I reset the breaker and get back to playing. Fast Forward and I'm almost to Whiterun but I run into the companions fighting a Troll, I shock it and of course one of them walks through my lightining. They immediately turn on me and I get fucked up, like sword through the sternum.

Adding a modding API will allow them to create personal content for the game, partly increasing its fanbase , e.g. a Star Wars mod that is really well written and interestingly designed can attract a wider range of people vastly decrease the amount work and time put into adding stuff from the official side as a result of chunks of code already being present create another sub-group of the community which will, without a doubt, develop in its own pace as well (ex. Minecraft's current modding community is rather huge) increase the amount ideas that can be taken into consideration for adding into the game due to the fact that on the one hand, working code already exists and can be tested to be valuable or not and on the other hand, modders spend more time actually thinking about cool stuff that would be nice (or not so nice) to have, adding a variety of playstyles and items create optional content that can enhance the players' gaming experience even more In my opinion, mods for Rebirth should of course be non-profit and its code should always be open source .

I felt blood on my neck and my vision started going black and my thoughts got blurry until everything went quiet and black and then I woke up. I even looked up what getting shot in the head is supposed to feel like, and the descriptions fairly matched mine. Last week was an interesting one where I was on a charter bus with a bunch of people touring some place with a volcano. The volcano started to erupt, sending lava down the hillside toward us. We tried to drive away, but then a larger explosion started which enveloped us in seconds. I just watched the fire and lava shooting toward me, accepting that I would die in less than a second, simultaneously feeling curious about what it would be like. I remember the moment the wall hit the bus, shattering the glass inward, and obliterating everything, but all I really sensed was a sudden impact too great to register anything else, and then and empty senseless blackness. This time the dream continued. I thought to myself \"so I guess I'm dead. I guess there's nothing when you die. Except I'm still thinking, I still have consciousness, that's weird.\" At which point I started to feel more sensation, my body came back to me, a light started to fill the void, and I thought maybe it was an afterlife, a heaven of some kind I was going to.

They are a slim fit Tommy Hilfiger jeans and sad to say they are now fading and the knees look like they might split soon. I have to find a new pair. I have three pairs of jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, Jack & Jones Anti-Fit, and a pair of Levi's. My main problem is a few things put together. I cannot stand a skinny cut but I like the pants to be slimmer/tighter below the knees. I have big thighs and a big ass for a man unfortunately so what ends up happening is either tightness in the upper thighs, tightness in the crotch, or the pants hanging off my ass. I dress business casual and I commonly wear dress shirts or sport shirts that aren't tucked in. I can't have the pants sagging off my ass, it just doesn't make for a good look. I can never find a compromise between these three issues: High rise(sit at waist or at least above the hips somewhat), comfortable space in the groin/crotch area, Not tight around upper thighs. Now, I've always been a bargain shopper and shopped at TJ Maxx outlets and other similar outlets getting my brand name clothing for under $30 but I'm fed up and I'm ready to start buying some shit that actually fits comfortably. Is raw denim my only option? Is it even an option? Also, a major thing I should mention as well is I need the material to not be too thick, I sweat a lot and I cannot stand when my legs get hot underneath my jeans (or any pants for that matter). For the record, I seem to have a similar issue with dress pants and khakis where the pants don't sit high at my waist. Thanks for reading and I hope to get some insight into this. I'm not a fashionable guy, I got the hot girl early on in life and I never really had to worry about my looks.

However, my vegetarian-ness IS \"pure\" so I would NOT pull the pepperoni pieces off a pizza and eat it. Couldn't do it. And yet, I eat out all the time. While I always ask to confirm if the ingredients used in a meal are vegetarian, I rarely ask how their kitchen operates. Do they completely seperate their cooking spaces for meat and vegetables? I can taste the difference when a place is really sloppy about that, and I won't go back. At the end of the day, I'm not sure of the full details in their prep areas. On top of all that, reality is that when I purchase food from restaurants that serve meat, my money goes to their overall revenues, which they then use to buy more meat for their omnivore customers. If I eat cane sugar, it may have been processed using animal bones. I occasionally eat candy with gelatin, which is made from dead animal products unless specified otherwise.

Sex was okay, nothing groundbreaking...but I wasn't so experienced so I thought it was all great.

If you find that your herbal treatments are effective, it could be because they have an actual effect and it could be a placebo effect. Either way, results are results in my book. Don't substitute a much-needed chemotherapy treatment for jasmine and lavender salt scrubs. Don't leave things for too long if your holistic remedies are not effective as this will result in a molehill becoming a mountain to treat.

Don't condemn others for immunizing as YOU rely on the herd immunity this creates to stay healthy yourself, even if you don't choose to immunize. There is merit to herbal medicine. Many treatments date back to their herbal counterparts and modern pharmacology reflects this. Scientists were able to take what happened in nature and make it more concentrated, more effective, or more safe. Also remember that just because something is 'natural' does not make it safe. Herbal treatments still carry side-effects and can be harmful. There is still a risk of interactions between treatments.

She then gasps and immediately notifies my teacher, who then notifies my principal, who then notifies my parents. I get sent to the principals' office for a meeting with my parents. I'm crying and don't understand what I did wrong because I had heard my parents/family members use that word before and didn't know it was offensive. I don't remember the discussion that followed but I hope that my parents were ashamed for introducing such term a to my kindergarten vocabulary and for touting such bigotry.

I wanted to confront her about it, but a friend told me it could be true ( he's studying graphic design so i thought he might know something about it). Now i really, really regret it tho, since i told her to setup a date when she's absolutely sure she will have time, but i lost all control and now i have no idea when she's going to say anything ( if ever ). I don't think she's lost interest or is avoiding me since she follows me on instagram and has commented on my most recent picture ~1 week ago. I must also mention this whole issue started right after she started studying again, which makes it likely that she is busy, but... it's been like 4, 5 dates that she has canceled, first couple time it didn't even bothered me, but now it's just pissing me off. Am i reading way too much into this? How can someone be this irresponsible? My main idea is for her to set the date so if she cancels this time, i can now confront her and probably dont talk to her again, unless she says something that really convinces me, but how do i regain the control of the situation? because right now im just waiting for a text message that may or may never come.

Other people have said to incorperate your bow into the fights - do this, you can get runes to recharge your focus as well as gain arrows with different mechanics. Therefore you can take out more in bigger fights. It also makes sense to scout and see what you could be up against first. I always take a look and id my captains in the area before I start a fight so I know who I will be up against. As well, don't do the story right away.

I've seen so many good things posted about this game through stories about people interacting with each other/cops and authorities which makes me feel pretty good about people. Anyways, as I progressed through my weekend, I started wondering about the maximum speed at which you can go to maximize your egg hatching efficiency. The phones have pedometers in them and use gps so it knows whether or not your driving in a car. However I recently tested the speeds at which you can go. I first tested it at around 5 mph, then around 8 mph, then around 12 mph. I saw that the distance for the egg increased as the speed increased. However when I did the 12 mph test It didn't register as much distance as the first two speeds. From this I assume the best speed to really maximize your egg hatching would be around 6, 7, or 8 mph. This can be useful if you have the game on in the city (slowing down for traffic,pedestrains, stop signs, lights, etc), biking, jogging, or walking. Some other people might have different results but just thought I'd share what I found. If you have found anything different please comment for others to see, thanks!",

Once you kill a player, they rag-doll, and if a player is unconscious, they perform an animation of them falling down, and you can obviously tell if they're not dead just by looking at their body. Anyone who has killed a few survivors before begins to realize this fairly quickly, and it leaves no purpose to having the check pulse function in the game, other than seeing a player's username. I miss when you were always worried if another player was still alive after shooting at them, and either having to remember to double-tap them (rule #2 of Zombieland), or check their pulse and make sure they were warm to the touch. In no way am I complaining here about DayZ having rag-dolls, as it really is a big step for the game as a whole, but I'm simply sharing my opinion about them here, as I think that DayZ, as of now, doesn't need that feature.

Then all of the sudden she says that she loves me, but is no longer in love with me. And though there is a possibility of us getting back together, it wont be anytime soon. She still acts like she likes me, and I'm still very in love with her.

This dinner was pretty nice, there was guest speakers, a silent auction, good food, the works. I am a poor college kid so at $20 a plate, this dinner was not a cheap event to go to. Everyone was encouraged to bring a date and it kind of became a thing where if you didn't bring a date you would be sitting with all of the other rejects. I would not let this happen, so I bought two tickets and asked the girl that I am very interested in. She kindly said that she was busy at that time and it wasn't a big deal so I asked another girl that has caught my eye. This girl made up some excuse that I don't really believe as being true but I thought \"whatever\" and moved on. The third girl I asked was that \"for sure friend\" that you take when you can't find a date to something. Lo and behold, she was also busy at this time. With the deadline fast approaching and $20 of precious money on the line, I sent out a spread of text messages to various acquaintances asking if they wanted to go to the dinner. The first reply I got was an ex of a friend, but she was on good terms with everyone so it was ok for me to take her. At the dinner, my friends girlfriend was running late. She was in the same class as the first girl I asked so I made the statement that my first choice couldn't go because of that class. This was a mistake. My date was in shock that I would actually admit that she wasn't the first choice. Thinking I would make this up somehow, I decided to share that she wasn't my second choice, but in fact my fourth choice. This did not go over well at all and the rest of the dinner was very awkward. I tried to make conversation with the other people at my table, but the entire time you can just tell that my date was super pissed off.

Getting outpicked is as good as giving first blood sometimes and your playstyle is just going to have to reflect that inequality. The game doesn't start on equal footing. Adapting to that inequity is what I find particularly fun personally. (one of the reasons I loathe mirror matchups in teambuilder) I say this as someone who will play anything anywhere into any matchup and believe that every matchup can manage a neutral presence at worst with enough practice. The main issue I see with assassin playstyles is that they are countered with communication and decisiveness, an obvious flaw of solo queue play. Combined with the lack of teamplay and tendency towards selfishness in a random matching lends more hidden power to those that excel at skirmishes. I find that often if you are just patient and stay group the assassin players get impatient and suicide or misposition and your team can collapse and kill them, though in reality the team just splits up and fail to focus one down or spend too much chasing one kill then lose the fight anyway. With that said, its so delicate of a balance, though personally i much prefer having assassins than bruisers just being outright better. Bruisers need to be able to kill in a reasonable time but nobody would play assassins if they didn't kill fast enough to justify the loss of tank stats from a bruiser.",

I mean major cramping, diarrhea, they\u2019d last 7ish days and be heavy for 3-4 days, headaches, the works. I didn\u2019t skip any since Dec so I had a period in Dec, Jan, and then Feb after my last pack of pills.

Back when life expectancy was short and the potential for dying before producing offspring was a common occurrence regardless of social status or personal choices, the most reliable way to make sure your DNA survived was to have lots of children (preferably with as many different mates as possible, to ensure enough diversity and maximize the potential for getting the best mix of traits possible). In a hierarchical society, this means being able to have lots of children is a sign of social status. Much like people today value things that increase their social status (clothes, houses, etc.), people back then valued breeding ability. Since society was male dominated, only the men were capable of achieving high social status via the acquisition of the finest women for the purposes of making babies. Of course, how society became so male dominated in the first place (and why that has lessened in modern times) is a separate question entirely.",

They love each other to death, and get along so well, but are both extremely jealous over attention from me or my husband. If we pet or love on one, the other squeezes their way in between or just generally wants all the love. Nothing aggressive at all just excitement, its just then they start wrestling for our love and we get run over by two 70-75 lb dogs. The Pitt is older and lazy and the GS is, well active... So we do get to spend equal time with them cuddling or playing depending on each of their moods. Any tips to get them to stop trampling each other for our attention when we're petting the other? The GS absolutely will not roll over anymore. Instead he lays down, gets back up spins in a circle and lays back down expecting a treat!? We were vigilant with all types of training. Since he was 8 wks old I can count on one hand each time he had an accident in the house. Tricks were the same, he can sit with silent hand commands or snapping fingers, shake, lay down, fetch and knows \"drop it\" (that was for the puppy days). It took more time for lay down, roll over but he got it pretty quickly. Just one day he decided \"heh heh maybe she'll think I did it if I just spin around instead.\" I try to work on it a little everyday but due to the above problem I have to put the Pitt in our room or somewhere else in order to keep his attention.

I pull back my exhausted troops, and the Mori push on, driving the yellow banners back. At last, the Oda daimyo falls, and his army breaks.

But I had regrouped my soldiers. I smashed my Mori allies from behind; their slow, tired men were no match for my shock troops. Trapped on the bridge, the Mori Daimyo died, and his army was annihilated. With the Mori armies destroyed, it was easy for me to take his lands and the precious armouries within.

Firstly, i don't mean laughing as in laughing out loud, more of the shaking kind of laugh thats quiet. For example, if i was listening to a coir with friends or family around me (people i knew), and someones voice broke, i would quietly laugh. But sometimes i can't stop laughing, like for minutes i stop and then start again. This is amplified if a friend was to laugh as well, because i would keep laughing as long as there laughing. Another example has occurred when i had to read something out load in class and if i found something funny, i would kind laugh and it my voice would be shaky. This is one example that i think links to social anxiety, because reading out loud can be an uncomfortable task. Now, the worst situation that i laugh in is one thats situated around bad news or a tragedy. If someone told me that a child died or someone i knew or had met died, i would generally feel bad. However, if the tragedy is about someone that i have never met and have no feelings for, then I'm more prone to laughing. Its kind of like i have an empathy gap. An example would be, if a friend told me there friends mother died in a car car crash (this hasn't happened btw).

I think that all strains of feminism (and feminists) get a bad name because of the limited ideology of specific strains of the movement (like Valerie Solaris' S.C.U.M. manifesto... which most people argue was satirical anyway; it was a hyperbolic joke, not a serious call to cut up men)- and because of Rush Limbaugh's catchy little \"femi-nazi\" term. Feminism has grown and changed, and continues to do so as our society at large grows and changes. First-Wave feminism (the feminism of the 1800s, concerned with economic and political empowerment) was largely successful (yay! we can vote), but didn't address the societal gender discrimination (sadface; we were still defined by our reproductive and sexual roles), so Second-Wave feminism rose up to address those issues. Then, in the late 20th century, Third-Wave feminism rose up in response to the perception (in my opinion, the valid perception) that feminist movements only addressed the feminine experience in terms of middle-class white women. Third-Wave feminism, and the post-feminist movements that have sprung out of it, focus more on addressing how gender issues interact with racism/classism/homophobia - all the other stupid ways we separate ourselves from ourselves. I feel like a lot of people (women and men) see feminism as a stagnant, constant thing. This is not true. And the movement has internal disagreements - like the difference between feminists who see some gender differences as inherent while those who see all gender difference as the result of social conditioning. Anyway, the OED says a feminist is \"an advocate or supporter of the rights and equality of women\". And, if feminism is about equal rights for women (which, at its root, it always has been - it's just gone through different phases over its history), then I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many people in the US (or the rest of the west) who are really opposed to it.",

The magic packet contains the MAC address of the target machine, to ensure that other machines don't get started by it (the software you use to send the packet will make ask you for a MAC address). The difficulty is with getting the packet delivered when there is no IP address currently assigned to that machine (because it's off). This is solved by sending it to the broadcast address (e.g. 192.168.1.255), such that it is delivered to the entire network. Unfortunately, a lot of NAT routers will not let you forward a port to the broadcast address, so it can be a bit hard to get it working over the internet, as opposed to just on your local network. If your router will forward to the broadcast address, some magic-packet sending software will let you send to an IP address other than the current broadcast, on the assumption that port-forwarding happens somewhere. It may also be possible to use regular port forwarding (to an ordinary IP) if your router has a setting to always assign a given IP to a given MAC address.",

The object of my affection isn't one of the characters but rather the feeling this VN gave me. I'm at a loss for words, much like Rin, but I don't have a medium to express myself through so I guess my last resort is a rant out here. I haven't experienced any such VNs before or played a dating sim (even though this felt far from it), so excuse me if this post reeks of newbie. I found this VN after some Facebook page posted an image with Emi on the ground and one of the dialogue options were \"What are thooooose?\". It made me chuckle, but also curious. I checked the comments to find out what it was about and all I could see was people praising the game left right and center. This piqued my interest and the next thing I know, I was downloading it. I'm here now, 3 days and 2 storylines into it and I'm at the point where I'm more than satisfied (and a bit overwhelmed), but I STILL want more of it. My first ending was the good one with Emi. That, in itself, was an incredible experience. Such a well written character with so much depth, I found myself side-by-side with Hisao on his rollercoaster of emotions. My next story led me to my favourite character thus far, probably the most interesting of them all (at a glance anyway) - Rin. The frustrating shrugs and laconic, nonchalant responses made the the entire experience, and the ending, just that much more tasteful. It sort of felt like the events of this story took part in a parallel universe, because Emi's arc was still fresh in my mind. Seeing her as a friend was unsettling at first, but pursuing Rin fixed that. I have spent the last half hour searching for other such experiences but something tells me anything I try won't give me the exact same feeling I am experiencing right now, which is precisely what I want more of.",

But you can't offer a date and then say you are free in two weeks, right?

Eigther you get lucky and almost oneshot their adc or you get unlucky and almost deal no damage. The key word here is LUCK. Honestly, a stat like crit that is chance based shouldn't be in a game where you don't fire off a lot shots. F.ex. it works fine in a game like World of Warcraft or Borderlands where you shoot like a madman causing the end result to reflect your crit-chance. The sample size in those games are large enough to give you the end result of 20 % crit chance = 20 % increased damage. But in a game like League of Legends your sample-size is so much smaller making it more luckbased. F.ex. you can end up with 2 crits in a row with 1 % crit chance or end up with 5 crits in a row with only 20 % crit chance. Instead of giving the 20 % damage increase that the 20 % crit should give, you end up with 500 % dmg increase. You can also end up with 5 hits in a row without any crits at all. So now to the actual suggestion: We've seen that Ashe has a system that works quite fine completely removing the RNG of the crit stat. This could be implemented on every champion by making your AA's hits for a percentage additional dmg based on your crit chance. F.ex. 20 % crit chance would make your AA's hit for 20 % additional damage. Note: It shouldn't increase your total AD since this would make champs whose abilities scale on AD quite OP.",

For example, The few times I've played games where people do run LD, they tend to do something along the lines of: Wrath the board -> play their hand of huge fatties -> armageddon when no one has any creatures in play, and are all in top deck mode. Why do people hate this? Because unlike instawin combos, armageddon is never the last spell of the game, and never wins on the spot. It turns the game into \"can I draw lands and spells to win before I am beat to death by a horde of 4/4 angels.\" And generally the answer is no; but some people will play draw pass with the hope that they can win. The general idea is this; ramp is powerful, yes. Utility lands are powerful, yes. But the way many people play LD is they try to lock another player out of the game by making it so they can't cast spells, something that no one thinks is fun. No one is going to argue and say that spot land removal is a bad thing (I kill cabal coffers every time I see it) but mass LD cuts people out of games. The other problem with LD is that the poeple who do play it (and I've argued with people who disagree) build their decks so that the suposedly \"symmetrical\" effect isn't, either because they have mana rocks, or because they have the only board presence, or because they sandbagged lands for 4 turns so they could make their land drops after. Yes, ramp decks are powerful. I am fully aware the UG is one of the most powerful combinations of colors out there. But there are better ways of handling it than Mass LD, or color screwing.",

Anyway, things didn't work out because of issues I have with myself and maybe some bad luck. The point is, I don't see it happening anytime soon. And I want sex. I need sex. Like real bad. Since I don't have enough style to be welcomed in most gay bars, I figured using grindr would probably be my best option. Thing is, I have never used a dating site/app, and I feel completely at a loss about how to set up the whole thing. Plus, the whole dating/cruising apps thing makes me a little nervous\u2026 I need a grindr beginner guide, a grindr 101 course if you will. Now to the questions: 1) I understand that the number of pictures you can put on your profile is pretty limited. Since I\u2019m sure this is the one biggest factor pushing guys to contact you I want to choose wisely. I have a pretty athletic body and I could definitely compete in the headless torso category, but is it something that really works? Or is a face shot better and you see from there? A full body shot without a shirt would really make me feel like a tool and is not an option. 2) What do you talk about? Let's say I spot a guy I like. Basically I'm going to talk to him because I want him to fuck me, not to talk politics or literature. Am I expected to find some kind of conversation starters or can I actually be really blunt about what I want? 3) How long do you generally chat with a guy before meeting somewhere? 4) What the fuck do I put for a name? Or in the two-liner? I\u2019m guessing that both things are less important than point #1 but I want to score. What kind of things would make you more likely to contact a guy after seeing his profile? 5) Any other recommendation? I\u2019m looking for efficiency here. P.S.: I know about safe sex.

That's why people with really terrible PMO addictions can find themselves experiencing erectile dysfunction as a result of their addiction (it can get to the point where your brain is so conditioned for fake stuff that a real person doesn't \"do it\" for you anymore). This \"re-wiring\" is so strong that simply substituting real sexual intercourse for masturbation is not sufficient. It won't generally work to just say, \"Oh, I'm very aroused. Normally, I would masturbate, but instead, I'll have sex with my wife.\" You're still stuck in that feedback loop. For this reason, a lot of folks on [SUBREDDIT] seem to have had better success abstaining from any sexual activity for a period of time (30 or 90 days is common) than just substituting a licit outlet for the drive for the illicit outlet. If you get married and you don't have your porn/masturbation problem under control, it's just going to be a problem in your marriage. Trust me. I figured it wouldn't be an issue (at the time, I wasn't even sure I had any moral qualms about masturbation, yet it still caused problems for us). Getting married so you have a licit means of orgasm is not a good way to enter into the sacrament of matrimony. Not only is that a really irresponsible and unstable foundation for a marriage, it's also not going to help much (if at all) for most people with this issue.",

I'm sure this will make much more sense if you watch a video on YouTube. Also, if you are still having trouble, find a local cigar shop in your area, and bring the lighter in.

While the part about being ready for mobilisation is true, the part about preventing home break ins is not, at least from what I have been taught during the army.

Of course some people have ammo at home as they shoot for hobby or stole them during their service...not that uncommon. But I don't remember anyone defending themselves with it. Unfortunately studies have shown that the firearms was more often use for suicide and from time to time, random killings. Ammo should also not be placed anywhere near the gun and if I am not mistaking, is no longer kept at home now. Source: Been there, done that.",

The rain held off for another 20 minutes or so, which should have been enough time for me to get back. I got lost. Davy Crockett lost (\"I can't say as ever I was lost, but I was bewildered once for three days\"). I blundered my back the way I came. The rain started sheeting down, it was crunchy. This was no spring shower, this was a full-on tsunami of water. 90 minutes passes and I crest a hill and see the Jeep as the rain slows and stops. It's all red and sparkly, it looks freshly washed. Inside there is a few inches of water in the bottom (I didn't yet know about the plugs in the floor pans). The seats are like sponges, every time I move cold water seeps into my ass.

It helps the doctors make a living (and enables them to continue providing services), it helps the owner avoid unwanted surprises, it helps many pets avoid health problems, and it helps the pet community. Also, when given a choice between adopting from a shelter or a pet-store, a shelter is a more ethical option. Although you may not be able to get a puppy or kitten, a one year old will offer a similar ownership experience. I personally love older cats and dogs, so this has always been a great option for my family. To clarify, if you and your girlfriend were only willing to adopt on the condition of declawing, that is your decision to make. It is still a very common procedure as many pet owners share your concerns. I understand your decision, but just make sure you understand the consequences if your kitty ever escapes.",

I'm thinking to my self, \"well maybe he really has to pee?\" But 2 seconds later i see him burst out of that bathroom and run upstairs. SO I am sitting there in a 2v1 screaming like wtf!! WHERE ARE YOU!! and I start to hear a shower going. At this point I just say fuck it and quit. He comes out 15 min later and told me that there was no toilet paper downstairs so he ran upstairs. While he was pulling down his pants, he pooped directly into them and had to throw his clothes away and take a shower. We dropped from platinum to gold league over that game. Because he pooped his pants. LOL! Edit:",

I looked at my shave and realized I had new soap, a Personna 74 blade I've used for shaves and a new brush and decided it was too much new Shave Soap Scent: This is a classic barbershop scent. It is more powdery and unisex than Seville, leaning more toward the Clubman end of things. It has a bit of a floral nose to it and very little tang or musk. Performance: This loaded really easily and using the marco method I accidentally over watered just a tad, so the second pass was best after it was worked a bit more. It had that Arko like quality where it didn't seem to matter how much soap you loaded, it felt like simply staring at it might cause it to lather. Lather was stable and thick with good thickness. I felt it left my face feeling good, but I think Black Label and regular Tallow have slightly better post shave feel. I didn't feel I needed aftershave. Splash Scent: The scent of this is slightly different than the soap. I get less powder and more musk. It gives it a slightly more cologne-like scent though very similar. Scent is very strong and I can see it lasting for a little while. Perhaps the ingredientsof the splash change the scent sligthly. Performance: This didn't feel needed, but I used it anyway. I put a tiny bit in my hand to feel it before I showered. It had a very thin texture that absorbed easily. It felt ever so slightly tacky when applied to dry skin. After shaving it felt very similar to an alcohol splash, absorbed quickly and had no tacky feel. It almost made my skin feel powdery.",

It definitely appears that they have an awareness of their current owner, and we even got hints that there was some kind of internal translator. Clearly, these rings tapped into some ambient background-energy of the universe, and - through an impossibly complex series of haptic and sensory inputs - channels this energy outwards in the form of hard light.
