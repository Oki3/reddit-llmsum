I ran off after him but he had disappeared. 10 hours later, his dad phoned to say he had arrived safely at his apartment in Edinburgh, Scotland. The kid had hitchhiked 300 miles, barefoot. He returned home after spending six months with his dad, during which he shoplifted and truanted from school. Years later, I disowned him after a string of robberies and assaults were linked to him. He got his girl pregnant so he joined the army but they split up when he went to prison for going AWOL too many times. His mother died two years later and our relationship went into a steep decline ending in his permanent banishment from our home. He burgled the house repeatedly, threatened his brothers and assaulted his father until he finally ended up in prison for beating up his ex's new boyfriend. No matter what he did, his brothers stood by him which made it almost impossible for me to maintain any control over the situation. In desperation, I started to spend more and more time away, assuming that the less I was around, the sooner the situation would return to normal. It didn't. We hadn't spoken in years when I spotted him walking past a cafe I was in with his brothers. I'd just been paid and had given each of them a wad of cash and I wanted to give him his share, no matter what our differences. Before I had a chance to give him his envelope, he turned and stalked away. That was the last I saw of him until recently when we became friends on Facebook.

Some of the main differences I have seen haven't even been in play style or mechanics, but rather it has simply item builds for different situations.

When I see the lower elo players in game I never see any true adjustments to what the enemy team is buying or what is needed in that match. What I see is that they have a set desire on what they want to buy based off of what has worked before. It has become a common occurrence I have noticed and the shift is ridiculous and sometimes I feel it truly does define why some games are lost by teams. I see Lee Sins who instead of building tank items get a hydra in bronze while the plat players I play with get the randuins because that is what is needed to win.

Still, it helps to lay it all out there. Basically, it stems from a well-known banking chain here in the US being asshats. In the two years that I've worked for my company, who uses said bank for their deposits, some nightly deposits have just never shown up. Usually it's $200-$300 and they've just been delayed and I can get proof of them - Not in these two cases. The first one was $850 and since I was the one whose name was on the paperwork, I was responsible to pay it back after going round and round with the bank. That was a year ago. I paid it back, done. Oh, but we're not done yet. It's happened AGAIN this year, this time to the tune of $1016. 2 solid calendar weeks have gone by before I'd heard that it never cleared the bank - WTF? So, this time I'm more than likely looking at being fired if I can't get it resolved - at the VERY minimum having to pay this one back as well - which will in turn knock my take-home pay down about 50%, including my wage garnishment for an old student loan, and a mandatory \"reimbursement\" to my company because I got overpaid (not my fault - our payment processor's fault). If I lose my job, I lose my car - which is bad because I'm in the hiring process for a MUCH better job with a 30-40 minute commute each day. We don't have any public transit in my area, so losing my car means no job, which in turn means still having no money to pay ANY of my bills.

You're intentionally misleading the viewer. Letting them on thinking that what they see was actually what was there.

Having the touch of pages, the smell of a new book, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love those things too, but the ease of reading an e-book is what is making them so popular, just like mp3s. And for the people who complain about having to pay over $100 for an e-reader itself? Remember the iPod? They were around $400 when they first came out. Standard size ones are still over $100 (IIRC). Although not entirely the same situation, there are many similarities. Just as CD stores have suffered a bit from mp3 sales, book stores will see relatively similar results. But I agree with you in a way. I used to be a huge fan of physical books, their smell, etc. However, more recently I have adapted to using an e-reader and love everything about it. It's one of those things that once you try, it's hard to go back. I tried reading a physical book that wasn't available on the Kindle and found it much more stressful. It might not seem like much, but holding the book up, dealing with it trying to close if it's a larger book, turning the pages, etc. With an e-reader you are able to sink yourself into the story with ease.",

The grinding brings back memories from maplestory, RO1, and other grindy mmos. It also brings in a social aspect that I have not seen in a long long time. More often then not when I form a farming party we get talking about ourselves and whats going on in our lives and become instant friends. I have had more social interactions in this closed beta than I have had in the entirety of the last year in MMOs. It makes the grinding fun and personal on a whole other level. When you're up at those high levels it actually feels like something was completed, some insurmountable achievement under your belt. You finally get to that class you wanted to reach and it -feels- like you're that bad-ass class, not just some novice who somehow in 2 days got to a really high rank. It removes the meaning of the higher classes if the leveling speed is exceptionally faster. Another point I want to make is that too much these days you hear \"The game starts when you hit max level\". Okay? So you're telling me I have to hit endgame for the game to be enjoyable? What about before then? So basically close my eyes and spam to max level ASAP. Okay. You see, the thing I liked about grindy MMOs like this is that it really puts emphases on the journey, and not the destination. Mix a few quests and some gear enhancement systems and you've got me hooked. I feel like max level should be almost unreachable, and when it is achieved, the person who did it basically goes down in gaming history. Like in maplestory, if you mention fangblade, almost everyone is gonna know who he is. (The first person to hit the old level cap).",

This allowed me to attack and claim French towns for my own with only the French being pissed off and blocking me from only the French cities for trading. So I was going to keep taking over French towns till Tampa was the last one left and then finish that off as well to completely remove the French. However, at the 2nd to last town, it would not allow me to claim the town saying this would make the French too weak! Pretty much seems like a fail safe to keep the 4 nations on the map permanently. When I went back to Tampa to then claim it for the Spanish side atleast, figuring since I can't claim it myself atleast I would remove the French from there, it did not allow me to that either due to the same reason. Now obviously that whole scenario is in a loop where I cant really destory Tampa and the Adeventure campaign cant really move forward.

You go to the moment before any choice in anyone's life, no matter how small or big the choice. Say the person chose to eat a bagel over cereal for breakfast one morning.

If given that same choice, at that same point in time (Without anything about their history or preferences changing) an infinite number of times, they will always choose the bagel. So they didn't really make a choice, it was dictated all along by every moment in their life before that one. Sure that same person could choose cereal over a bagel the next day, but that is because they ate a bagel the day before and they had 24 hours of experiences between those 2 choices. They didn't change their mind about their original choice, eating cereal is just another act that they did, because there was nothing else they could possibly do. I can't see how there can possibly be freewill when all of your thoughts and actions are made based on all of the things you have experienced before that choice.

The story of the leavers illustrates that there isn't just one way for human beings to act, but thousands, each suited to the conditions and environment of the community they develop in. The wisdom of the Navajo would have little practical use for the Ta\u00edno. The takers force their wisdom/ideology upon primitive cultures and destroy those that do not assimilate (Cain vs Abel, Colonists vs Indigenous people everywhere). This isn't really a requirement per se, your professor is just trying to make sure that you produce a cogent paper. I would keep in mind that Quinn isn't against ALL agriculture, merely the aggressive form practiced by Western Civilization. He is suggesting that humans should live in tribes, as they have for 98% of their existence and should realize that they exist as part of the environment, rather than in opposition to it. I don't want to do your homework for you, so I'll just suggest that you look into Anarcho-Primitivism, especially Derrick Jensen, who has been heavily influenced by Quinn's ideas.

A standard tapper doesn't have a ton of low kick, and usually has a uniform flex point, much like a wooden hockey stick (something Bauer dressed up in their nexus line and charged a premium for). What this means for your hand positioning is that your lower hand needs to be fairly low on the stick to get the pop composites are known for.

At this point in the story he started to get visibly annoyed. He said that he wouldn't go for any tests, because he could guarantee that he didn't have anything. He laughed off the idea of going, even after I insisted he did. In the end, he told her he loved her so he could sleep with her, slept with her a couple of times, then deleted her number off his phone because she was 'too clingy'.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that our midfield is not what it used to be but I don't see why we aren't just looking to promote from within. Rafinha has shown all season that he is a very solid player and I think if he's given consistent minutes he can become world class. He fits in very well with the changing system that we have now, he has some very promising potential and a good relationship with lucho. Not only that, but we also have to consider players like Denis Su\u00e1rez and Sergi Samper and even Halilovic further down the road. From what I've seen from Sergi Samper, he looks like the real deal. I believe that he could be one of the next barca greats, but if we buy a young midfielder like Pogba, Veratti or Kovacic, there will be even less of a place for our young players. Iniesta and Xavi are on the decline in terms of what they can handle physically, but Rakitic and Busquets are not going anywhere. Busquets could still be anchoring our midfield for another 8 years as he's only 26. If we buy another 23 year old they're going to be expected to be playing there for many years, and then there won't be another consistent starting spot in the midfield until Rakitic either leaves or grows old like Xavi and Iniesta. Not to mention that Iniesta could still be a pretty consistent starter next year. If Xavi leaves, Iniesta is still first Captain and your first captain isn't a supersub. My point is that we have spent all this time developing talent from La Masia that I think we really need to start investing in it once again at the highest level, sure it isn't the golden generation we have had in the past but there are some players there that are very clearly going to be world class talents.",

What im asking now: Forellenlord still is a free agent, top 20 challenger and to the opposite of kerp a REAL midlaner(kerp switched from top to mid), Millenium should just shake off their proud and pick him up again. I dont see there any chance staying in LCS for millenium otherwise. Forellenlord got godlike mechanics and is a good shotcaller, as he has shown last season.

In order to stop scv pulls from happening, protoss needs either aoe in storm to make a meat grinder for scvs so they are ineffective, or the army backing up the scvs needs to be weaker in comparison to the protoss army. If gateway units are buffed to the point that they can cost effectively trade with bio in the midgame, and even beat pulled scvs + bio then terran wouldn't have any options. Also I disagree that protoss late game is that favored anyway. Ghost viking is actually really good if you know how to use it and scans allow you to snipe high Templar. Just watch taeja play late game tvp. I admit that it does get harder once late late game comes though because tempests make it hard to engage.

There are many reasons why they stay that way. The consumer demands what they are used to, all the way down to the size of the box. General Mills and Kelloggs both [test marketed]( a bag in box cereal that was more effective in size to hold more product with less packaging. People didn't buy them. So the reasoning for the shape and bag in box is consumer driven. If people will buy less of a product with new packaging, why spend the money to develop new equipment, processes, packaging, and machinery. The reason for the few inches of headspace is for the artificial atmosphere and ease of processing. Imagine how many boxes of cereal a factory will churn out in a day, they need equipment uptime and reliability. If they pack the bag full, they will spill product, and have an improper seal. The headspace will allow the sealing machinery to seal the product effectively without damaging the product.",

The way this comes about is a patient will come in to the hospital after a trauma, or come to my attention as a consult after a major event and one of the doctors or EMS people on the field told the patient's family that they are brain dead or in a coma or something similarly dire I don't know what is actually being said to the families, but by the time i get there the family thinks the person is in a coma, brain dead, vegetative or whatever. Usually a quick neurological exam at the bedside will let me tell them that the patient is in fact, not brain dead, or not in a coma. the family attributes this to a miracle, while it was actually either a misunderstanding or an over-call by the initial doctors.

Brain death is pretty specific and irrevesible, you aren't brain dead until you are in fact brain dead and you can't be a little brain dead.

Keep in mind that Asperger's is on the Autistic spectrum. Some general 'symptoms', if you would call them that, are things like not knowing what is appropriate in social situations, struggling to take social cues (for example someone keeps hinting they don't want to talk politely and you don't realise) and sometimes taking things people say very literally. But you know what, no matter what it is perfectly fine. You don't need a diagnosis and nothing is 'wrong' with you. I know personally that most people see me as a rather social, out-going person but I slip up socially every now and then. Sometimes I say something the moment I think of it, then realise I've offended someone or taken a sarcastic comment seriously. I think the real reason is that social protocols change in so many situations and often don't make sense.

Couldnt care about the specs, they seem fine for everyday persons use, and the build quality will no doubt be exceptional. As apple has proven to me, they can use low end hardware properly and still deliver a great experience. But heres the catch... One port of expansion. One. Not even a standard yet, USB C.

We decide it's too loud in the cafeteria (where the dance was being held) so we want to walk around the school and continue to talk. Unfortunately, there was a couple sitting on the fucking floor, blocking us from leaving. Some bolder people that wanted to get out stepped over them, which I suggested, but my friends wanted to wait it out because they were a bit socially awkward back then. After fifteen minutes I was getting frustrated. I picked up a glow stick from the floor, walked to secluded spot where the doorway was in view, and whipped it at them. They didn't fucking notice. I found a second glow stick and tried again. Still nothing. My friends and some other people are watching me at this point. I tried a third time and it hit the girl in the ear. She starts screaming and the guy gets up and walks towards me. I was a scrawny kid so I was scared shitless. I couldn't believe that I had such a bad idea. Did I really think that it would work? Anyways, he comes over and screams \"DID YOU FUCKING THROW A GLOW STICK AT MY GIRLFRIEND?\" I reply, \"What are you talking about? I didn't throw anything!\" He insists I did. I insist I did not. I ask my friends to vouch for me. They say I didn't do anything. Luckily nobody else that saw me has bothered to speak up. He finally gets frustrated and leaves.

After all, we work in advertising, and somehow these companies have convinced people to consume something that will kill them. If there was only some other product that could fulfill all that smoking does without the danger, you'd become instantly very very rich. There has to be something intrinsically related to cigarettes, beyond the buzz, beyond the chemical addiction, beyond some generic concept of coolness that makes them so appealing. Here's what we decided on. Cigarette smoking is controllable social segmentation. You're at a party where you don't know anybody? No problem, your people are there for you on the balcony or patio. There's always something to talk about. Oh, you smoke blacks? I smoke reds. Plus an entire system of stereotypes to conform to or subvert in your own way. Cigarette smoking is always an excuse to break from something unpleasant. Don't like the current company? Don't like how work is going? Take a smoke break. When you're a cigarette smoker, you're never bored. Because there's always something to do, always a cigarette to be smoked. And most fundamentally (my partner studied psychology and gave a great argument for this) cigarette smoking is fundamentally related to the act of breathing, which is one of our most basic purest instincts. Very few products modify breathing in a way that builds social proof. It's a very zen hybrid of introverted and extroverted satisfactions.",

Muscles are like those cheap appliances that have no \"on/off\" switch, but automatically turn on whenever they are plugged in. There is no separate \"off\" neurotransmitter. Either the muscle neurotransmitter is going, or it isn't. If your muscles are contracting, then it is going. If they are relaxed, then it is not going and the cells have eliminated whatever neurotransmitter was there. Ever wonder where rigor mortis comes from? That's when those nerve cells release all their reserves of that neurotransmitter. The now-dead cells can't clear it away like they did in life, so all the muscles stiffen and remain contracted until the neurotransmitter degrades. Continuing on from semantics, I can find no studies that show acupuncture can single out specific muscles and cause relaxation. The most that has been published by non-biased journals shows that it has an overall pain-relieving effect via triggering [endorphins]( AKA endogenous morphines, and can [stimulate the parasympathetic system]( AKA body-wide relaxation.

Back then my pride and joy was my Pokemon LeafGreen, which had my legitimate Shiny gyarados (not Lake of Rage, found as a Magikarp) which i had trained to Level 100. Also on that file were every one of my legendaries which I had traded over from other games, and all my favorite Pokemon. Anyways, at the party, everyone was having a great time, playing Pokemon and everything. The time to cut the cake had arrived, so we all were heading over to the Kitchen. When we came back, I didn't find any game cartridge in my GameBoy. I panicked for 30 minutes straight. Everyone was still there and none of them claimed to know where the game was. At that point I was so disappointed I began to cry (probably for more than 10 minutes straight). Later that weekend, my friend called saying that my game was stolen and who took it. Apparently it was one of his friends who I didnt know very well, and lived 2 hours away from us. One year ago, I found that the person who stole my game also stole multiple of my other friends' games, and he went to our school. Turns out he was a really nice guy and we're now best friends, although I still give him shit about stealing my LeafGreen.",

That summer most of my friends had some home for a few weeks from college, and my friend D invited me and some other friends one night to go drive around with him. We were bored and spent several nights that summer just driving around at night exploring. We drove about 10 minutes south of where I live and out onto some rural roads in his car, just cruising, seeing what we could see. We did this several times and found some pretty cool roads that were pitch black at night. At the time I had an F150, and we started taking it out at night. When we got there everyone would pile into the bed of the truck except for the driver, and then we would fly down these bumpy back roads with the wind blowing in our faces. During one of the instances, I was in the bed, and another friend, who is a pretty crazy driver, was driving my truck. We were flying through curves and over bumps, and then in a moment of flat, calm road, I stopped hanging on and sat down on the side of the truck bed. A few seconds later we hit a huge dip on a slight curve, and my ass lost contact with the side of the truck, my body completely in the air. With nothing to hold onto, I felt myself falling backwards for an instant, and my instinct seemed to be to hold my and legs out to balance myself, which only felt scarier, and as time stretched into what seemed several seconds (in reality it was an instant, and I was probably less than an inch above the side) I thought surely I was going to thrown out at probably 40 mph. Somehow I landed back on my ass and balanced myself again on the side, my arms flailing to stop myself from teetering over. I immediately sat back down in the bed, having avoided I'm sure several broken bones and serious road rash if not death.",

A: irony. unsinkable ship sinks its just like the too big to fail bank jokes a few years ago. B: there is obvious human error involved. any number of things could have helped in the tragedy of the titanic and human error is funny in hindsight. the two tower incident (or 911) is similarly unfunny for a few reasons. A: their was no accident those people meant to do what they did(or almost did in a few cases). these people willingly killed themselves for the sake of killing others. its like the thought of a kamikaze to a world war 2 vet the feelings are similar. the Idea of a hatred so powerful that it overrides the survival instinct is scary. B: the location. people die in the sea and we all know this it's practically a racial memory the 911 thing happened in the middle of a sizable island. this isn't normal land tragedy are paths of destruction not a few buildings in particular. C: the buildings were monuments landmarks. landmarks aren't suppose to be hurt it's common courtesy and if you don't have that on the battlefield war becomes a worse hell than most can imagine. D: the weapon. humans in general don't like flight the idea of falling is scary for obvious reasons. and knowing that any vehicle you could be in that fly's could be used in a plot like this is once again scary. the real thing that keeps 911 from being funny is the fact that A: the landmark thing again and B: we just don't have enough safety precautions for an event like this to be stopped (at least not ones that the civilian populace can understand and easily communicate to others) for us to put our fears to rest.",

To get better at crossfit, you should really make strength your priority. I see so many crossfitters that can't figure out why they're plateauing on workouts and I always tell them it's because they focus too much on metcons and not enough on lifting. Making yourself stronger will inherently make you better at metcons, it doesn't work vice versa. I.e. increasing the amount of push ups you can do in a 10 minute span won't increase your bench press max. To put in in another perspective, take two people. You have 4 weeks to prepare them for a competition. You know there will be some cardio intensive metcons, as well as some heavy lifting involved. Person1 is great at metcons and the cardio side of things, but relatively weak. Person2 is strong as hell, but relatively \"out of shape\" from a cardio perspective.

Everything you do is an investment to grow the value of your project. So you want a high return for each investment and minimise waste like overhead, sunk costs and debt. For example: manually designing and creating art for every level style/type has a fixed costs per level-type (like brushing a new tileset for every type costs same for each style). But procedurally modifying/generating/re-combining assets to get the new style only requires a chunk of time up front (writing the system) and has a lower cost per usage (modify just few params and get a whole new style). This can get a lot of value IF you capitalise on it and make sure you get back the time you invested in writing that system . No use writing that system and using it twice. Instead you would use it many times and generate a lot more value from it. Think about what value would mean for you project. Is it play length? Amount of gameplay options? Plain fun? Detail level? What do players want from your game? Once you know this then everything you do should improve your value bottomline. Sometimes this even means dropping features!

He's (taking a few liberties here) like a toned down version of Phelps as a lobbyist. Previously he's been vocal on things like internet censorship, clergy-based child abuse, media classification (one of the loudest opponents of R-rated games), and pretty much everything that can be thought of with an anti-gay perspective. To be fair, the vast majority of Australian Christians do not support the strength of his views, even if they share similar ones. For instance, Christians I know might say that gays have a risky lifestyle due to AIDS, but they wouldn't go on and say that smoking was better than being gay. The media loves him, because he makes great press. His followers support him, because he's technically right on matters of faith (as I understand it - but bible knowledge is not one of my strengths). Most Australians read about him, go \"what a dickhead, shouldn't he be preaching love, not hate?\" then go back to their breakfast.",

However, about 2 months ago we hit a plateau and our community wasn't nearly as active as it used to be. So we decided to take a hiatus so that we could take some time to get to know our community better, figure out what they wanted to see from us, and also so that we could spend a few weeks reflecting on our show. During this time, we made lots of improvements to our workflow, and figured out ways to make the show more interesting to our viewers. Communicating with individual fans helped a lot. Our biggest fear was that our audience wouldn't be there once we were ready to come back, but when we released our first new episode last Tuesday, we found that our community was stronger than ever. We picked up lots of new fans via Twitter, Facebook, iTunes, and a few other outlets, and we found that people really appreciated all the improvements we'd made. Taking a break for a few weeks to regroup helped a lot more than we thought it would, and ended up being a great decision.

A lot of crazy shit happened, including a camper being sent home for pulling a knife on the rest of the unit, but my favorite was the summer we were besieged by bears. This family of bears just decided they didn't give a fuck and started brazenly traipsing through the tent units to get to the dumpster behind the kitchen.

My group happened to be stationed in the tent unit they passed through every night, so we kept having to sleep in the dining hall or squeeze into a cabin with another group. Finally the dumpster was moved and the bears went away, but the girls were still nervous about sleeping in the unit. We (the counselors) decided the best way to deal with their fear was to work them into a blood frenzy. We had 20 twelve year old girls dancing around a campfire with mud on their faces singing about bringing the head of the bear back on a pike. One girl ran off and pissed in the treehouse to 'mark our territory.' We slept in the unit that night, and the counselors were all pretty on edge despite all our bravado. We had pots and pans next to our beds ready to start clankin' at the first sign of bear activity. Then, around midnight, we heard something big walking through the campsite. THIS IS IT, we thought. We all sprang upright in bed, whaling on that crockery like our lives and the lives of 20 minors depended on it and screaming the Little Red Wagon song at the top of our lungs.

Now, my theory is this: the center of the galaxy is the beginning of multiplayer. Specifically, I think it's there that you will earn the ability to form parties or track your friends. Think about it. Sean said that they will have traditional multiplayer (either planned or at least \"not at launch\", whatever that means) and one of the main limitations would be that your friends would be so far away, spread across the quintillion stars. It would be unlikely to ever run into anyone because of the sheer vastness of the galaxy. But that's the thing. Everyone is being funneled into this central point. So eventually, the likelyhood of running into somebody is going to skyrocket the closer you get to the center.

I expect people will be phased in and out (like ESO's Megaserver, or Destiny's tower) but people on your list will have priority.

It was awesome though playing with them on not only a classic map but a workshop map. The communication was clear, such as directions where to go and who had what. The skill was very good too. Lots of times I'd be one tapped by enemies, and others I'd see some teammate AWP 4 people in 4 seconds. Its not likely you will ever get paired with 4 other human beings in MM that have even the slightest of that. Win or lose everyone was a good sport and knew it wasn't a big deal if you choked or missed all 20 shots in you M4A1s. I am now going to do my best to play in every community night from here on out in NA and would like others to encourage others here on this subreddit to do the same.

I added sci fi energies also, like one that is mostly used in weapons and another that is used in shielding. That part, even if complicated, I'm proud of.

Specificity = True Negatives / (False Positives + True Negatives) as false positives go up, specificity goes down. When I look at the bipolar patients and calculate sensitivity and specificity (using the criteria they chose, that nonviolent attempts do not count), I get 95.5% sens / 23.1% spec. This is truly basic statistics. So the way they calculated a 96% specificity is bullshit as far as I can tell. It looks like they took True Negative / All negative = 96%. This calculation actually gives you the negative predictive value (NPV) of this test for suicide in a bipolar population. The NPV can be helpful in characterizing a test but should never be confused with the specificity and is highly dependent on the prevalence of suicide in the tested population - it's not intrinsic to the test. Looking further in the paper they have this jewel of a line: >The present computation evokes interesting theoretical issues regarding the interpretation of the concept of specificity. For example, is the observed high raw specificity due to a low background frequency of suicides or to a high frequency of suicide preventing reactivity? There are no \"theoretical issues\" regarding interpretation of specificity, they just calculated the NPV instead, which is known to vary with prevalence (or \"background frequency\") of the condition of interest.",

So while you're correct that in theory, the two chains could be used independently, this will not be the case in reality. To illustrate let's say you're buying something from me and you're paying me with bitcoins on the new chain. You broadcast the transaction and I get the new bitcoins. So far so good. But now I'm kind of an asshole and I take your transaction and also broadcast it on the old chain. BOOM! I get your old bitcoins too and there's not much you can do about it. The only way to prevent the above scenario is if a transaction is being broadcast on both chains, but only gets included into a block on one of them, but not on the other. That way there exists a short window where the unconfirmed transaction on the one chain can be \"doublespent\", aka sent to a different address instead. Now you have your coins in two different addresses on the two chains, and therefore they're really separated. Because this is extremely confusing to the user, I would assume that there will be nodes intentionally connecting the two chains by broadcasting all transaction on both chains simultaneously. But because one chain has a larger blocksize than the other, there will necessarily be cases where intentional or unintentional splitting of coins between the two chains happens.

I personally do not think very highly of the Taliban, but the Taliban were a political party that existed within the normal, stable government of Afghanistan. I'm pretty sure more people died in Afghanistan because of US military actions than by the hand of the Taliban, let alone the unrest and the now extreme unstable situation which makes it necessary to train security forces. The US went in there, trashed a country and wanted them to say \"Thanks!\". It's not the job of the US military to destroy towns to get a few al'Qaida while there still is the KKK in America killing people. My point is: The US military acts like America is the best country there is and they therefore have the right to enforce their superior morale by force. But it's just not that way. America is no better than any other country. But quite a lot of countries hate America because they know that the US military will kick in their door if they do something the US does not approve.

The government was pretty motivated to maintain peace with the tribes, what with the colonists breaking the agreements already in place (and against the express wishes of the government) and expanding westward into tribal territories that, by treaty, they were supposed to stay out of.",

Brett Keane owns the restaurant, we go, and he steals our car by poking us with a pin right above a contract (claiming we signed it with our blood). We call the police on him, but he disappears. Later that week, we find him barricaded in the restaurant, he escapes and we go on a car chase. Eventually, we find he and his family (of like 10 kids) in a crowded alleyway. The SWAT and I search the entire alley, eventually getting help from a nearby church who hates Brett Keane, and we hunt down his kids. I personally find a ten year old holding a knife by grabbing him through a wall while Beyonce hit him in the head with a sledgehammer. I take the kid back to Brett's compound, where there are now thousands of kids, and I beat Brett up until he tells me the truth: he dumped the car in the ocean years ago (even though he stole it years ago). I start to tear up, but then knock Brett out. I then learn that Rockstar has taken the events and turned it into a GTA V level, although no one seems to know about it.

I thought maybe I was just having an asthma attack or something so I kept biking. As soon as I topped the hill, less than five feet away from me was a huge cougar. I immediate braked and we stared at each other for a solid minute before he hunched down and growled at me. I have no clue why I didn't run or bike like hell out of there, but I remembered reading that if you lower your head beneath theirs (makes you look submissive or some shit) that they will leave you alone. I slowly got off my bike, got down on all fours and curled up in a ball. I laid there for a few seconds waiting to hear it walk off into the woods. Then, I felt it's whiskers on my arms as it was sniffing me. I was freaking the fuck out man. Luckily right around that time, a hunter fired his gun and ran up. It scared the cougar off.

However, as he could not afford the ticket previously, i paid for half the ticket around ( 600 sgd) and also forked out additional 1.5K for his two months here.

I am not advocating that you make obtaining money your whole life goal, but you've gotta realize that life is easier when you've got more of it.

I finally decided weekends and holidays just weren't going to cut it, and if I ever wanted to finish it I'd need funding to work on it full time.

I think there are a lot of people who would really like to see this project happen; it's just a case of getting the page in front of them. So now I've explained where I'm coming from, here is my question: How can I approach the relevant subreddits without getting in trouble?

PvP is obvious, the difference vs PvE and PvM is that PvE is essentially the whole game without PvP (what you do) whereas PvM means vs Monsters (before: really hard bosses, now: any monsters) The tag of PvE has mostly fallen into disuse in RS though. In Runescape PvM evolved at first to mean high level bossing, so PvM was equated to high difficulty (relative) monsters such as GWD/KQ/KBD (before Kiln/Corp/Nex). Years ago (Before dung. Before Nex. Before extremes, before gravestones even) PvM clans were less popular and more elite and a helluva lot more fun imho, but that's neither here nor there. Anyways PvM was the pinnacle of awesomeness. Owning a full phat set was not as sexy as being part of a real known PvM clan, staking was it's own beast and impressive in it's own right, but PvM was still toping the charts. For some reason flippers command more respect that PvM bossers now, this used to be the opposite. As such PvM was difficult and elite, a holy grail of sorts and the meaning has changed over the years (Can be seen by forums as well, used to have PvP and PvM forums, now Monsters) It annoys me too because I feel like lower levels are pissing on what I used to feel RS was by naming themselves PvM, even though since the meaning has sort of evolved to include PvE it's hard to blame them.",

Well, about 10 of us were sitting around in the living room, introducing ourselves, eating cake. A couple of the roommates were pretty drunk, and sat down on the couch across the room from me. So I go first, and I'm like, \"Hey, my name is Jacki.\" and this boy looks at me from across the room, eyes glazed over, and says really loud, \"THATS MY EXGIRLFRIENDS NAME\". I notice he is cute, but I didn't think anything of it, because WHO SAYS THAT? well, we all keep talking, and me and drunk boy find out that we are in the same 700 person psych class for freshman that neither one of us took yet, so (being a confident bday girl), I look across the room at him, throw my phone at him and say \"put your number in my phone.\" I texted him about a study guide the next class, and after a few classes of texting back and forth and using going over to our friends apartments as an excuse to see each other, we fell in love and have been together for the past 10 months, LD since June. I have never been so incredibly happy. We are great together.",

But religious faith is strengthened by community and social support. If you live 10 miles from your nearest neighbor, you're more likely to send them a letter than lean over your fence to have a conversation. So while a farmer may favor lower taxes, limited government, and generally libertarian values, his religious views are probably informed more by his sources of information (TV, Internet, radio, other media) than his interaction with his community. Especially with modern communication, the idea that one must belong to a church to be an upstanding member of society has fallen away. And there's much more competition for faithful members, as individuals are no longer limited to the building within driving range of their home. So if your local pastor happens to support increased federal grazing fees, it's much easier to leave that group and find another that more closely mirrors your own beliefs. This has the double-sided effect of making specific group members more adamant in their belief, and also reducing the wider appeal of each individual church. As a result, you see opposing churches cannibalizing each other in a desperate attempt to steal members, while in the process turning off more and more people to the idea that faith is a necessary component of life.",

Me and my friends drive to a convenience store where this guy wants to meet me. Takes him forever but he finally gets there. He must be about 17 years old. I ask to see the phone, and I go into the settings and I verify the serial number the owner of the phone gave me. It was the same number. I calmly tell the guy that we aren't giving it back because it's a stolen phone and that we can call the police if he wants. He tells us that his friend just sold him the phone, and asks if we own the car we were next to and we say yes. He says he'll be back, but as soon as he leaves, so do we. (We're not idiots.)

Further, the ISPs who own the cables can then offer their own high-bandwidth services at low cost. Imagine if the hydro company was allowed to charge whatever they wanted for electricity. There's only the one company that owns cables that go to your house so you're pretty much forced to pay them.

The CRTC has decided that the data transmission utility companies are no longer bound by any duty to provide their product at a reasonable rate. The reason that 'pay for what you use' is the issue is that small ISPs would offer unlimited plans in a second and make their money on volume if they could, but because the big ISPs are going to charge them through the nose for every gig they're no longer able to provide those plans.

Don't let her remain a source of stress in your life. It sucks, but some people aren't worth including in your life. The ex who broke up with me right before I met my wife tried to cause issues with us once we were dating, and it was as that point I just cut her out of my life completely. Since doing that, she has never been a factor. She's tried to initiate contact a few times over the years (most notably the week before our wedding and when she caught wind of the fact that my wife and I were expecting our first child) but I ignored it every time. Not to be mean, but simply because there was nothing in my life missing that she could provide.",

There are some species who have penis' that flange out barbs (like an arrowhead) during intercourse making it impossible to remove until the male ejaculates. Females of such species have evolved false vaginas so that they have a certain degree of control over who they are impregnated by. I.e. if/when they are being raped by an undesirable male, they will guide the rapist's penis into a canal that does not lead to the cervix where the sperm will just die off. A desirable mate's penis will be guided to the actual cervix. It's not even over once the female is impregnated. In fact, it gets even crazier. The incentives for evolution have some weird side-effects. For example, it's to the male's advantage to promote gestational growth even at the expense of the mother, (Because as long as the child lives and your genes are transmitted who cares if the mother dies? You can always impregnate another female) so there are certain genes promoted by males to hasten fetal development. Obviously this is NOT to the female's advantage as dying severely hampers their own ability to transmit genetic material so the female versions of these same genes delay fetal development. This has severe ramifications if one side is knocked out due to a random mutation. If the female genes are knocked out, the male genes act unopposed and you get angelman's syndrome. If the male genes are knocked out you get Prader-willie syndrome. You can also see the effects of this inter-gender arms race when an egg without genetic material is fertilized by a sperm anyway. In this case the male DNA replicates to form 46 chromosomes instead of the regular 23 from the dad and 23 from the mom. The unopposed male genes promoting gestational growth and development with no regard for the mother's life becomes [malignant](",
    "generated_summary": "In nature, the reproductive process between species involves an intricate \"arms race\" of adaptations. For instance, some male species have barbed penises that can't be removed until ejaculation, while females develop false vaginas for control over impregnation.

The night relaxed me and I urinated fine in the morning. I still don't know exactly what happened (the urologist is unable to determine what it is although they think it's prostatitis) but that memory plagues me to this day and I am unable to enjoy things such as trips or any extended period of time without access to a bathroom for fear that this will return (as it has a few more times although to a lesser extent than that first night). These two problems kinda suck since I have to drink a lot of water to avoid further constipation but that induces the need to urinate more frequently which absolutely terrifies me.

Given, the damage numbers, Vader's lightsaber attacks also do more damage than Luke's. Now you can argue that Luke has speed over Vader's strength but speed in a 1v1 doesn't matter at all because you can just block Luke's attacks and counter with your own and so you can't put vader in a lighsaber attack chain because if the vader knows how to block, that just becomes irrelevant. Vader also has a mechanic where his lightsaber throw, even if blocked staggers Luke so much that Vader can follow up with guaranteed choke damage which can't be blocked in time. Power attacks are pretty balanced because they do the same for both characters and have the same interaction so I don't have much to say about that.

I saw this everywhere, and immediately thought this was some new internent meme that would go away with time. It never did, and I began to think. What was it that I missed out on? Why was it that every other user seemed to know how or when to use this general and originless phrase yet I did not? After weeks of frustration, I finally decided to Google it. I googled \"slightly less boring than working\" and there it was. Fucking Downworthy. That damn Google Chorme plugin trolled me for weeks, changing all the generic syntax usually found in clickbait titles on every page I visited where users used similar wording. Thanks, Downworthy, for making me think I was the last Redditor on earth to hear about some internet joke and making me feel like an idiot.",

I tried a couple of different pills when I first went on birth control, but they all made me extremely emotional, (read: hysterical crying because someone forgot to say good morning). I ditched those all quickly and switched over to Depo. Over about seven years on Depo I had gained thirty pounds, slowly became depressed, and completely lost my sex drive. I went off B/C for two years, I lost the weight, the depression cleared right up, and my sex drive came back (with a vengance I might add). After a while the married + condoms routine got old so I got Mirena. I have absolutely no emotional or sexual complaints with Mirena. My doctor specifically recommended it to me since it should not affect either. I do have complaints though about cramping and spotting. It can get pretty painful, even after a year and a half. Now, some perspective. I've never had children, so my uterus is tiny. Mirena is supposedly only for women who have already had children but my doctor felt it would be fine for me. From what I've gathered, women who have had children tend not to experience much pain or cramping. Spotting can be an issue from what I understand though. With Mirena I only spot though, I don't get periods anymore. At most I get eight to ten hours of period level bleeding every month and a half or so. I'll sometimes spot a few days ahead of or after that, but even that is somewhat random. I've never had a problem with acne, so I have no idea how Mirena would change/not change that.

Well, I had to squint at the video for a while (around 7:00), but I managed to convince myself that when the disc warps, it moves the individual bits of the disc closer to the axis of rotation (it reduces the moment-arm of each dV of disc), and thus lowers the rotational energy.

Now please don't laugh at the next part my fellow techs; my in the floor heat is not a boiler, but rather a 60000 BTU water heater (it was installed temporarily until I began work on and completed a snow melt system which would require more BTUs) I live in Michigan (brutally cold winter) and my in the floor heat is all I need to run. That's right, I heat the whole house with a 60000 btu water heater! Most Michigan residences, with force air are paying $200 to $300 in monthly gas bills, my last one was $156. Reason is: Radiant floor heat does not heat the air, which is a poor medium for transferring heat and better suited as an insulator. A forced air furnace \"scorches\" the air and dumps it into the space, it then rises to the top. 85% of heat loss in a house is through the ceiling. The builders did the right thing by installing a 150000 BTU furnace in a 1950 sq ft house because the design requires a lot more BTUs when you are trying to heat with air.

My theory is that their pact that began so long ago (bravo and thief) is still very much alive, to a deeper degree than most realize. Illyrio clearly supports Daenerys, having lent her his support in sending Barristan and then Tyrion her way. It is also worth noting that he originally supported Viserys and hoped he would succeed, not having considered Daenerys even a contender until her \"rebirth\". Varys more clearly supports Aegon, having allegedly made the baby swap that saved his life in infancy. Now, Varys was a part of the plot to help assassinate Daenerys. He had to carry out his orders, lest he be seen as false. He may have sent warning to Jorah Mormont or Illyrio, but all the same he saw to the plans, knowing full well that she may die. I believe Varys is a Targaryen loyalist. There was a passage in an AFFC Jaime chapter: \"When this battle is done, I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago but... Well it does no good to speak of roads not taken. We shall talk when we return.\" Rhaegar says that to Jaime. I believe the council is to the point of removing Aerys from power, and I believe Varys was part of the plan, most likely a central motivator for it. Targaryen loyalist or not, he likely knew that they wouldn't remain in power long with the Mad King at the head of the Kingdoms. Illyrio and Varys having both Daenerys and Aegon to support and bank on effectively doubles their chances of seeing a Targaryen restored to the throne--and in their support it would gain them high honors.",

In the real world however, we do not need such complicated things. Hold up a heavy rock with a stick then put some bait under it. With a little luck, you'll catch yourself a small critter for dinner. This is my first suggestion. A stone(any kind really) on top of a stick (like an upside down lever) would make a Deadfall Trap. These traps would be placed on the ground, taking up 1 block. You can then right-click this trap with some kind of vegetarian food to bait it. Given some time, the trap will collapse and right clicking it will open a little window where you can grab a piece of meat (if the trap was successful). We don't have to physically add rabbits or squirrels (after all, we don't have fish). And we don't have to alter the effectiveness of these traps in any way. If we wanted to be more complicated, we could add rabbits that would avoid players and wander towards baited traps. Traps don't have to be 100% kill rate, but perhaps a better bait will increase the chance (rabbits love carrots), As well as the number of traps in that chunk. We can restrict the placement of the traps to only areas where the sun shines. There's a lot of technical things we can address about these traps. This is a start. The Deadfall trap would be very easy to make and provide a way to \"farm\" meat. They could be set up faster and earlier than a wheat farm and don't require you to physically chase down animals. The utility of this change of course isn't significant by any means, but boy it would add a nice feeling to the survival aspect of the game. This post is getting long, but my other idea would be a fishing net, made from 9 strings, that could be placed along waterfronts and baited to automatically catch fish.

We don't teach children to do math, we teach children to hate math. Not liking it doesn't fucking matter. You need to know multiple ways to solve a problem and think critically, or else you're that smug, useless snot who thinks barfing out their favorite author's opinions on things can change reality if they're presented with statistical data. There is no singular \"problem solving skill.\" You need a few different ways of solving different problems. Not wanting to do math-related topics in college or at work doesn't mean the math skills you were taught in high school. Living in the world isn't a buffet where you pick and choose your life challenges based on which ones you think would be easiest to solve. Plus, through about early high school, pretty much all math is practical. I use the quadratic equation very little in my life, but arithmetic and algebra in particular? Adults absolutely need to know these things. You know all those lottery winners and sports stars who end up going bankrupt almost immediately? They don't go bankrupt just because they're stupid spendy idiots (though I guess if the people criticizing have the same math skills as those bozos, they might interpret it that way), they go bankrupt because the basics of finance (which is math!) aren't something they'd ever been taught or bothered to learn. If you don't understand those basics, that's what happens. It's easy to be taken advantage of, and it's easy to not know what you're doing, when you've always brushed aside anything math related as \"pointless abstract numbers.\" People want to chalk it up to those individuals being particularly stupid or money somehow driving people insane, but it's because those people don't really understand math either.",

A player no longer needs to double up on any item because there are enough items that it's better to diversify your stats. In League, there is always a mathematically \"best\" build path for any given situation. That takes into account the stats you get, how your champion puts them to use, and the gold efficiency of the items you're buying. What this means is that yes, in each role there is a general build that's quite simply the best. This doesn't mean that there's no room for variation depending on the enemy team and their champions (building to counter the enemy team is always wise), but what it does mean is that the builds are always going to look similar. So yes, this means that right now top lane is sunfire and spirit visage, because mathematically these are the best items for those champions right now (though they are being nerfed next patch, so we'll see some diversity soon). This also means that there is an optimal way to build any champion, in any of the lanes you mentioned. I don't think it's correct to say that there aren't enough items, because there are vastly more options than ever before. The issue is that no mater how many items Riot adds or changes, there will always be the items that are the \"best,\" and the rest won't often be built because they're just not the best. No matter if Riot nerfs the strong items or buffs the weak ones or adds new ones altogether, there will always be a specific set of items that provide the best stats in the game for the gold they cost. Finally, the last big item release was not Blade of the Ruined King. They completely revamped support items, adding several new items and build paths.

In the Holocaust, the Nazi government/leadership was in direct control of what was happening to the Jews and there was a lot of paperwork during the time which entailed name, ID number, \"race,\" etc. This made keeping track of the Jewish prisoners much easier, even after the war (not to mention the branding/scarring that made it obvious who was a victim). As a result of this, it made sense for the government itself to compensate the Holocaust victims/survivors directly, and it could be handled (somewhat) efficiently. Conversely, during slavery, slaves were private property, and not in direct control of the government (even though many government officials had their own slaves). Also, slaves were primarily treated like livestock, merely treated as a number on an inventory report in certain cases. This made emancipated slaves harder to keep track of. The fact that the US government did not dictate how the slave owners should treat their slaves is a valid reason for the lack of reparations to slaves and their descendants. The reason the US government has given reparations to Native Americans and those in Japanese internment camps is because those injustices were directly handled (and were sanctioned) by the national government.

By utilizing resistance training, more receptors are placed on the skeletal-muscle system than the fat-stores for \"fuel goes here\".... to a point. As the fat-stores reduce in density of energy available, less receptors are needed to keep them from catabolic balance into the negative and things \"balance out\", neither fat nor muscle is reaching positive or excess or gainz.

Except people like Tommy Robinson come out looking like martyrs because they just get shouted down. Tommy Robinson is the head of a group of BNP offshoots who give Nazi salutes in public. Even if he is not personally a racist, he certainly works to push their agenda. 2) It's 2013. Racists don't march down the streets in Klan robes waiving swastika flags and shouting \"I hold a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race!!!\" (Merriam Webster). They create or infiltrate groups whose mission statement is not overtly racist but where they know they will find wide support. The Tea Party (which someone posted Penn Jillette interview about in another thread), is not overtly racist. It claims to be a movement against big government, and you can probably find a few token blacks in a tea party rally, but that doesn't stop tons and tons of their members from saying shit like \"Obama is an Arab terrorist\", \"Obama is the food stamp president', etc. Which, again, are (not so) covertly racist.",

Humans, Chimpanzees and many other animals have this. So, I'm taking your question as you wanting to know the advantages of it and why we simply cannot move them independently. First of which is, is that you have an increased field of vision, so you could see more things with one unified form of vision through binocular vision. Also, if you were to hurt one of the eyes, the other eye could serve, more or less, the same purpose. If you were to hurt a squirrel's right eye, you essentially blind the squirrel from knowing anything happening on the right side. For a human, if you were to hurt your right eye, your left eye could see most of the things that the right eye could. The final reason is, is that you have a higher level of perception due to two eyes working for one field of vision. This is related with the higher field of vision. It gives us a sense of a 3D environment. So, our eyes are actually independent muscles but they're controlled by one portion of the brain so it comes together as a unified image. This essentially explains why you can't move them separately... It is because the boss of the eyes, the brain only has one sector which receives and puts together the information. However, there is sort of a glitch to this system. It's called \"Binocular Rivalry\". It is basically, the two eyes being showed two different images and the brain alters which ones it has to listen to and because of various studies, there are many illusions you could do with it. There are various conditions regarding binocular vision failing what it has to do in the manner that it should but that's for another day. I'll recommend you do some of you own research if you want to learn more. This could be done via Wikipedia or Encyclopedia Britannica. cringe I'm not an eye specialist or anything, I used to be quite interested in the topic and asked my",

There is this girl in class with me, let's call her Anne, so I never really liked Anne or was attracted to her, let me describe her, to me she was never beautiful, she wears a pair of eye glasses and a head scarf you know the one that covers hair and neck. Now I'm not sexy or attractive myself, not at all, I have a lot of issues from Middle and High school, I've never been with a girl, and of course I'm a virgin.

Yes she's not the most beautiful girl I've known but she turns me on for some reason. Lately she's been on a diet and lost some weight, took her glasses off and put some makeup, she looks pleasant now, but not beautiful however, anyway a while ago she's told a mutual friend she likes me, and since then I've sort of tried to keep her away from me so she wouldn't be heart broken. Recently I think I started to develop feelings for her, she's the nicest girl to me, as a friend of course. Now this is how things go in the middle east, you like a girl, you propose to her family, engagement for a while and then marriage, and the best I'll get close to her during that period is holding hands, not even hugs. At this point I'm not sure if I'm starting to like her because I'm horny and miserable or because I love her, the trade off is quite heard, I can't propose to her when I'm not sure of my feelings, that would break her heart later.

All this to say, I don't get a chance to practice being anything other than a friendly professional very often. In the past year, I've turned to several online dating services for more dates: OkCupid, Tinder, Coffee Meets Bagel, and even Reddit's [SUBREDDIT]. As a result of these using these every day I pull in about 2 dates a month. Once on the date, I seriously don't know how to act. The conversation flows like it would with any friend but that seems to be a real problem in and of itself (i.e. it just feels like talking to a friend). Conversation topics have been wide-ranging from jobs, hobbies, college, interests, favorite music, favorite coffee, how we dream about having different lives, etc. So I don't think awkward pauses are an issue... I'm no expert at body language but I can see a \"I'm bored\" look on just about anyone and by the end of the date the laughing turns to this. There is no lingering talk outside of a bar or restaurant...just a quick hug and her making a beeline to the nearest cab or car. Furthermore, future texts usually go unanswered...

So I was waiting for my P.E teacher to arrive and was hanging out by the football field with a bunch of friends. The football field had a concrete floor and was about 10 feet lower than the platform me and my friends were standing on, and there was a barrier which was about waist high separating football field from where I was. Relevant information: I was quite athletic back then, and was pretty good at jumping over stuff and climbing stuff. I mean abnormally good (not to brag or anything :P). Anyway, one of my friends says \"Hey, think you can jump over that barrier there?\" I had jumped it many times in many different ways, but there was one way which I was always kind of afraid/knew I couldn't clear, which was to go with no running start, just hop over it. So, my brain had one of those truly full retard moments and was like \"Hey, now's your chance to try that impossible shit you've always known you can't do...\" And so I did. And the thing is, I ALMOST cleared that, but the tip of my left foot hit the barrier, I lost my balance and crashed hard on the ground below, elbows first. At first I didn't really realize what had happened then I looked at my left elbow (which was completely and utterly disfigured) and I just thought \"Well shit...\" It didn't even hurt that bad, believe it or not. Everyone around me were flipping their shit, I heard a girl go like \"OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG\" and all I could think was \"Wtf, just call an ambulance and get me to the hospital.\", and I was pretty chill.

Today I'm wearing a cast cause I went to remove some bolts n'shit last monday.

Nothing wrong with that. On the other hand you have guys who buy flashy cars and then would get smoked by grandma in a honda accord at the track. They just want something that says \"hey world, i must have a pretty big dick, im pretty important, etc...\" In reality I know some of these guys have NEVER floored it because they're too scared. They just like the sound and looking at it in the garage, and how maybe someone will find them attractive if they're in it. It's the same with trucks. You have guys who buy trucks to off road, to tow, to do construction work, etc... They treat a truck same as the racing guy if they're offroading, or if it's for work they treat it like a piece of farm equipment. Nothing suspicious about that. Then you have guys who buy the biggest blackest truck, lift it, throw the chepaest 24\" rims they can find on it and would cry their little eyes out if it got a scratch.",

Its a LOT of money to push into the open market directly without oversight. While I am sure at the outset there would be regulation you have to take the long-view which, in my mind, shows that markets naturally de-regulate over time.

In a given year, if you make more then some # you are mandated to self-invest in some regulated fund. If you make less welcome to SS!

I don't think there's anything unethical about the masturbatory act in itself- it's simply satisfying a physiological desire that every living organism has. That being said, pornography itself has it's own ethical and interpersonal repercussions. Besides what Grizzleyt pointed out, I think it has an anti-social and voyeuristic aspect which could be unhealthy if indulged in to an extreme. I.e., the sexual impulse is a drive for social interaction and even self-improvement. When the libido is completely mitigated through masturbation and pornography, there is little or no desire to satysfy those needs in a social context- however, I think the over-saturation of porn in our culture is a symptom of anti-social behavior and not a cause. The reason masturbation is derogative in an artistic or intellectual context is that these are supposed to be productive pursuits, with a goal of expanding ones emotional or mental capacities. Intellectual masturbation can be fun, but often leaves one as unsatisfied as literal masturbation.",

I had stalled for about 3-4 weeks, I chalked it up to gaining some muscle at first because I had just started lifting, but then I got a hernia (unrelated) and was still stalled, then I thought it was due to lack of exercise as I had been cycling 3-4 times per week and had to stop due to the injury. I believe now, that it was due to a protein shake I was using as breakfast every morning. It is a good shake, and I will probably continue on it once I'm down a bit more and I get this damn hernia fixed, but in the meantime, I lost 10 more lbs in the last couple weeks after discontinuing the shakes! The shakes are only ~7g net carbs, and 20g protein and I was adding coconut and mct oils but I think it was the culprit. NSV: I also gained a whole wardrobe that was in storage, down from XXXL to XXL shirts and 48 to 44 pants. The question(s): Has anyone just felt generally wierd for a while after starting this diet? I've had anxiety issues for years, so every little thing causes me to think I'm dying, so to speak. Just curious if its common, certainly won't stop me until something actually happens. I'm due for some blood work soon, so that should help me relax a bit. Does anyone float around the 50-100 carb range or is that too high. Right now, I'm generally at 20-30, but sometimes I get stuck going to a restaurant with friends or clients and i'll get breaded fish or mozzarella sticks, as they're usually the closest thing I'm willing to eat, but they will definitely put me in the 50-100 range for the day.",

Now take the warm tropical zone of the Atlantic, where you have vast amounts of rising and falling air and take that together with the Coriolis effect; which due to the particular rotation of the earth, means falling air once it hits the earth will be pushed in a West to Northwest fashion; once this air is far enough north, the Coriolis effect has far less power, and the Northernly Jet stream starts to catch the wind, so it will move more north, eventually moving NE/East; by this point a storm sytem is usually in Norther New England, or dead in the middle of the Bible belt.",

What I actually received was the stuff that I ordered but they upgraded Apple dumpling to a 30ml unicorn bottle, and added Sweet Peach Treat and Pineapple Nut Bread. So overall I'm pretty stoked to have received more juice than I ordered. Thank you and shout out to [USER]-sauce! Review: I have been vaping on my Sigelei 50w v2 on a Lemo 2 at .5ohms and at 33w Muffin Tops: 4/5 Out of the box I get a lot of cinnamon flavor, akin to BXvapors Horchata-tas without the rice flavor. It is also a little less sweeter. I'm going to let it steep and come back to it. Apple Dumpling: 5/5 I'm not that big of a fan of apple flavors but this is definitely my favorite apple vape. I get a lot of a green apple like taste on the inhale and on the exhale I get a lot of the sweet and cinnamon crust like flavor. Sweet Peach Treat: 5/5 I get an almost sweet peach iced tea flavor. I also get a hint of cinnamon on the exhale. The peach is very prominent and is a very satisfying vape. Has very good ADV potential for me. Pineapple Nut Bread: TBD Haven't touched it yet but I am definitely excited to try it out. I'm not really a fan of pineapple flavors but my friend who tried it, liked it a lot.",

    "input_text": "Pinkie being the \"villian\" was pretty anticlimactic and made it pretty crappy ending. Here's my thing: was that even the conflict? It felt like this episode literally had no coherent narrative, just a lot of pieces that COULD have been a narrative. The vibe I get is that this one was supposed to be an adventure story: great. So it's a D&D setup: you go in, explore, have escalating conflicts and then resolve into some kind of victory (or everyone dies, but obviously that wasn't going to happen). Here, nothing was fought, and nothing was gained. There was no significant obstacle to overcome, either living foe or environmental. Twilight got no information on the box (books, but that doesn't count). And the others each had mini-stories that sort of resolved, but you can't do justice to 4+ overlapping stories in 20 minutes, so they all fall flat. And honestly, they sucked anyway. Rarity exploring a castle to restore fabric isn't an adventure, just a lead-in. It's a reason to get her there, but then something else has to happen, and nothing significant does. Same with the others. Again, though, I'll certainly admit that at least this episode didn't reek of awful, and actually did have some charming moments. I was excited when Twi found the library in the beginning. And then she literally spent almost all of the rest of the episode doing nothing. That's the problem in a nutshell. The whole thing kinda feels like the D&D session the RDP guy describes where Sandler had them go all the way to the frozen north, and break into an abandoned base with derelict robots and cryptic runes everywhere, only to have them shrug, go \"I dunno\" and go back to the mission hub having accomplished nothing.

Well you'll be happy to know, I've been well and truly punished for my opinion. I bet Prince_Shaar will be pleased.

I was screwing around, putting a nerd voice on to mimic the youtube gaming community, asking why anyone in their right mind would pay \u00a340 for this pile of junk. I clicked on the 'purchase' button as a joke, knowing there needed to be a second screen before the transaction went through. At this point I was pretending to buy it, with the intention of pulling out and teasing DICE with my patronage. When lo and behold, my fianc\u00e9e bust into the living room and gave me such a fright I dropped the controller, and by some inexplicable twist of fate, the x button was pressed as it bounced off the sofa. The loading purchase screen kicked in, I scrambled to hit cancel, but it was too late. 'Transaction successful.' I am now a horrified season pass owner of a game I've spent the last few weeks lambasting. How do I feel about this? Pretty appalled, but at the same time amused. Does anyone know if there's an option on settings to password protect transactions and prevent this kind of 'easy purchase' from happening again? I'm imagining a situation where I invite people round for dinner and their kids go on the playstation. The way it's currently set up, they could effectively bankrupt me in the space of a few hours. I suppose there's always a guest account option.

The kid in front of me had one of those fold up magnetic checkers games in the side pocket of his backpack. It fell out of his backpack and scattered little magnetic checkers everywhere. 2 cigarettes also fell out. I bent down to help the kid pick up his checkers. About the time I stood up, the teacher came up and took the checkers game and the cigarettes (I didnt notice them until I stood up) and walked back towards her desk. No word was said to us from the teacher. The only thing I thought was \"Man... he is sure in trouble!\" Later on that day, my dad gets a call from the school saying that I have been suspended for a week for having cigarettes at school. My dad was furious. I start getting interrogated (my dad is a cop) about it. At first... I tell him the god to honest truth. He doesnt believe me. He already had his mind made up about what the \"truth\" was... he just wanted to hear it from me. So I'm now caught in a catch 22. I tell the truth and he believes I'm lying... so, to not get into trouble for lying, I need to actually lie. So I made up some bullshit story about how they were mine and I only tried smoking once and didnt like it and was going to get rid of the other two... you get the idea. I basically told him what he wanted hear. It turned out better than I expected.

Wednesday night I pulled an all nighter, and went to sleep at 9 AM Thursday morning and did not wake up until 9 PM (with an intermittent break between 4-5).

She is very loving, and works hard, but she cannot keep a job. She has made some bad decisions in her early 20s that she regrets, but what can you do, we all have. She was raised a particular way and has all the book smarts in the world, but when it comes to real life situations, things are much different, and she's not entirely responsible. She has about 2 years left until she gets her degree, but things keep happening and she has to back track. Like I said, I really love this woman and would love to spend the rest of my life with her, but these things are very bothersome to me. Is there any advice you fellow redditors can give me? What should I do?",

I'd guess most teachers see about 70-100 students each day and every homework assignment/quiz/test/essay/whatever has to be graded for all of them. You can't do that just in class, you take that shit home. You stay up late, put in grades, comment on papers, and then you do it all again the next day. Summers are NOT June to September. A lot of teachers will still be going in to school for a week or two after the kids finish. And a lot of them are required to be in school about a week before school starts, and a lot will go in a week or so before that. Is there more \"time off\" for longer vacations? Maybe, depending on where you work. But it isn't a 7-2 job if you're doing it right. There's extra hours everyday that cut into all that \"free time\" people talk about teachers' having.

Unaware that every road with a rail stop was called Station road we ended up getting off at the wrong street. The taxi driver recognizing us as not being local told us that. We're in the wrong neighborhood and should just take a taxi back the other way. Figuring it was no big deal as it was 5pm and still very light we started walking down a one way street. The street was like something out of a movie. Bags of trash rolling like tumbleweeds down the street. A shirtless kid with a toy machine gun shooting at us and running inside...and two guys approaching us from the front and three more from the back. Trying to be inconspicuous and understanding that poor doesnt mean dangerous we pressed along trying not to look like a victim. Suddenly I hear. Car accelerate behind us and skid. I turn around and a man has attempted to run down the guys behind us. He is a 45 yr old Indian man driving a new Corolla the wrong way down the one way street. He pulls up along side of us and says \"Get in the car, these guys are going to rob you.\" It look around me and it suddenly all clicks as to what is happening. I hedge my bets and jumped in the car with guy. He said that as he was driving down main road he saw us walking and saw the group of guys split off to ambush us. So he turned around to come help. It took a bit to sink in and I still don't like to think about it, but having friends that got beaten and raped and even friends of friends go we're murdered while we were there, I realize that we probably weren't going to walk away. My wife was probably going to be gang raped and I was likely going to be shot. It was daytime, but we were basically alone in a secluded street. That man saved my life and my wife's.

    "input_text": "I keep seeing people repeat how EB/MoM is much worse than hybrid because it makes your ES function at only 30% effectiveness. This is wrong and I wanted to clear this misconception up. Warning: Math. The actual effectiveness of your ES with EB/MoM is really just a function of the ratio of your max ES to your max Life. I'll just define R = Max ES/Max Life for simplicity. Since 30% of damage goes to ES and 70% to life, as long as R<.3/.7 or about 43%, all of your ES will be used up before your life goes to 0, which means your ES is still 100% effective. If R>.43, the ES damage you take before life is reduced to 0 is .43*Max Life. Which means your ES Effectiveness % is .43/R. A better way to think of it might be, your ES is 100% effective up until 43% of your max life. After that, it is 0% effective. So for example, if you have 4k life, ES is 100% effective up to 1720. There are a few other considerations which are also important if we're comparing Hybrid ES/Life with EB/MoM. Con: EB/MoM takes a number of passive points to pull off. You probably also want Ghost Reaver or Zealot's Oath. Con: Your ES won't be 100% effective unless it's relatively small. However, it's usually going to be much better than the 30% people often say. Pro: Extra herald/aura. Pro: You can start using pots immediately after taking damage because you will have life to refill. Hybrid can't pot until losing all ES. I don't know whether or not EB/MoM is better than hybrid (or straight ES or Life), but I think it'll be better than many are giving it credit for.",

In the trophy range that I started the experiment (1100-1200) people are dumb. I had the majority of people dropping troops outside the south side of the base, without dropping a single troop among the collectors. Another favorite raid strategy was exemplified by someone dropping 30 gobs in the collectors, then dropping 100 barbs on the southside, and once all those troops were dead, dropping another 30 gobs to try and run the gauntlet to try and kill the 2 (empty) collectors inside the base. Watching 30 gobs try to run between 2 wiz towers is hilarious. People were not trying to raid for resources, but when the tried to raid for trophies, most of them failed too. When I dropped to lower trophy levels (800-900), I had better success, people obliged by dropping a couple of troops and then leaving, however, I didn't get that many takers. I usually had around 100K+ in each of my storages, so they could have gotten an easy 25-50K+, but most did not bite. I think even in the lower trophies, people just keep hitting next and will only look at a base if there are a lot of resources for the taking.

I have delusions of grandeur about how good I want to get, and if there's one thing I'm figuring out, I don't think I'll be able to get there on my own.

I have been practicing breathing exercises and it seems to have been helping a bit. Now this is where the story gets strange. I have very severe sleep apnea and snore very loudly. I saw a few doctors and had sleep studies done and recently got a CPAP machine. During my sleep study they found that I stopped breathing 205 times during the night. Within a couple of days our sex has dramatically improved. I am now lasting much longer without even doing breathing exercises. We are on a streak now of a week straight with 20-30 minute coitis. My only thought is that my mild PE was in part caused by my sleep apnea and lack of sleep.

The 1866 Winchester is a lever action rifle, has a loading port in the receiver, fired the 44 Henry cartridge, and used a tube magazine. None of these are things we associate with today's definition of a smooth bore, muzzle loading long arm. When a Winchester 1866 rifle is referred to as a 1866 \"musket,\" you should think of it like any other designation of the 1866 - like the \"carbine\" or \"sporting rifle\" - each one describing certain standard features. The Winchester Model 1866 musket, in its standard form had a 27\" barrel, 24\" magazine length, and a 17\" fore end. Their butt plates were flatter (not crescent shaped) and had a trapdoor. With the longer fore arm piece, also notice that the 66 musket has an additional barrel band. Its front sight served as the bayonet lug. George Madis in his authoritative book on Winchesters says, \"Because in the early days of the 1866 the word \"musket\" usually meant a very long and an unwieldy arm, the model 1866 musket was termed, \"The Infantry Rifle.\" Likely to help the poor sales that would come with such a negative connotation.",

Both times the piercing was performed by an APP member. First time, I was a little less knowledgeable, but I knew I needed a good piercer and good jewelry. Was pierced at an 18g with a neometal labret. The initial bar was longer for swelling, and the cab was 3mm. Had a pretty decent initial healing period (looking back, I did a good job with the aftercare despite being inexperienced with oral piercings), but things went south around the three month mark. My lip was NOT having it. Pain, swelling, extra tissue, lymph, lip trying to swallow the disc . It was awful. Every so often, with a lot of TLC, it would calm down for a week or so. But that would mean I had to be extremely careful about what I ate and how I used my lips with my husband. It wasn't fun, and it always ended up being pissy again. Here shows the reoccurring problem. Retired it. Waited 6-8ish weeks. Had been loyal to another APP member at this point, and visited him for the repierce. I requested a 12g anatometal labret because I had theories about the 18g being \"too thin\" and possibly migrating and maybe a 12g post would shut my lip up. Wrong. So wrong. It was pierced beautifully. There was no wonky angle, it sat flat against my teeth, and it felt sturdy as fuck. Within four weeks, I was back to having a seriously pissed off philtrum. This time the swelling was much worse, and I worked an entire shift where one side of my upper lip was completely balloon-like. Retired because I missed eating curry and kissing my husband.

Since you're getting the erection at the same time every day, it may be tied to a other parts of your daily ritual, like what you ate for breakfast or an increased blood pressure from a long walk across campus, or just from a natural ebb and flow related to the time you wake up on the days you have accounting class. Alternatively, you might have something called a 'fetish' related to a particular sight, sound, or smell present in the environment of your accounting class. A fetish is when your brain sexualizes something that isn't necessarily sexual. For example, some people have latex fetishes, so the particular feeling of that material on their skin causes pathways in the brain related to sexual arousal to activate and cause happy sexual feelings. Although why people have fetishes is unknown, popular theories suggest that when a person, especially biological males, are young, the parts of their brain that allow for awareness of sexuality 'turn on' at some point. This is probably a gradual process, so that as connections making it possible to get aroused start forming around genitalia or sexual acts, sometimes something about the smell of accounting textbooks or the sound of a person erasing a chalkboard get accidentally wired into the sexy sex circuiting as these connections form. Maybe a person has a hormonally produced erection for the first time while hiding under a table looking at bare feet.

As of early last year when I had an extensive conversation with the Comptrollers office, here is what my understanding, and therefore tax processing situation is: Services are broken into two buckets, taxable and non taxable services. Most \"application development\" falls under the non-taxable services -- however there is a phrase under the data processing services (a taxable service) that specifically mentions web pages. Therefore, the understanding that we came up with was that any time I build a website for a client, it's taxable. If I'm maintaining their website, it's taxable. If I'm doing staff aug (ie my people are there as employee replacements, and they're doing what the client tells them to do) or building an application to the client's specifications, then that is a non-taxable service. Now, things get ugly when you do both taxable services and non-taxable services for a client (say you build a website and you build them an app). The state sees those both then as taxable services. Like I said -- ugly. Now. In your case, I don't have enough details, but if the application is hitting services -- that are not a \"web page/web site\" (ie. just a service, custom code/application for them), then I would not charge them sales tax. However, if you built them an entire web site (marketing, etc.) then, unfortunately, my guess is that the services -- all of them -- would be taxable. Here's where it gets ugly... this portion of the law is very vague and, honestly it's frustrating because you're dealing with people with no understanding of technology and how all this stuff works together.

I was pretty proud of her, actually, because she had just finished rehab the week before, so when her page got passed to me, I wrote, \"I'm so happy that you finally finished rehab!!! Wishing you the best of luck!\" When we finally got our sheets back, I heard my friend gasp, and after class ended, she jumped up from her seat, heading towards me furiously. \"WHAT THE HELL?! This sheet got passed around to the ENTIRE CLASS and now everyone knows I was in rehab!\" She ran out crying, and remember just freezing at my seat, too shocked to say anything. Sad to say, people did read it and notice, because for the remainder of high school, she became the butt of druggie jokes, all because of my stupidity.

I'm just having a hard time trying to cope with the idea of her being gone (she leaves August 21st).

I know all sorts of numbers get thrown around, but .5lb per week seems to be about right. And if you're going to maximize your gains, you're going to be eating like a mother fucker. So I'll assume a 50% muscle to 50% fat gain we're looking at ~40 pounds of weight gain (20 lb fat, 20 lb muscle)in a year. So I'm going to exaggerate things to make my point here.

Now I know that weight gain (particularly muscle gain!) doesn't work quite that easily, but let's remember that number: +400 calories a day.

In an effort to make sure they remain funny, the Mods and the rest of the subreddit decided to create the JPL, to preserve, as the name suggests, these jokes for future generations, I mean, us in a few months time. While a joke is in the JPL, it's essentially banned from submissions. Sure, it might appear here and there in the comments section, and there may be an occasional (and I mean once-in-a-blue-moon) reference to a similar idea in a comic (such the \"Belgium's Battleform,\" from a while back, which depicted it as an ATM/Cashpoint/Bankomat, but for weapons), posters are encouraged to err on the side of caution concerning these jokes, lest their submission be removed.",

With a pen you can simply inject in a different spot, but with a pump you need to insert a new infusion which isn't always an easy thing to do (I was at school in this case) The day started out fine, woke up with 4.8 and had my usual breakfast. When I measured my BG two hours later it was at 13.7. No big deal, just bolus a bit and wait it out. My BG quickly rised to 16.7 at lunchtime and 20.5 just an hour later. After a lot of aggressive bolussing, I got it down to 13.8 by 4:30 and decided to go home for the day. At home my BG was 3.4! I didn't bolus for dinner and still ended up at 2.2 two hours later. Fast forward four hours of measuring every 15 minutes and eating/drinking constantly while floating between 2.0 and 7.0 all the time (might I add I didn't have any insulin since my 4:30 bolus and even turned off the basal rate before dinner). I think I've drank a good two liters of apple juice, ate two bananas, five sandwiches, had dinner, ate 7 granola bars and threw up twice in the past four hours. The lesson learned: don't ignore a lipo and definitely don't let it grow like I did (I think it had about 50 units of rapid acting insulin in it), those fuckers pack a punch when they finally start releasing again!",

I did not do any research regarding whether or not this topic has been posted before, but I haven't seen it in my year or so of redditing. Being as the person who introduced me to LoL was a competitive scene fangay, I got introduced to the wonderful scene of LCS. I have loved every second (literally, every second. With the exception of 4 games I missed due to a hospital visit for my Mother - yes I watched the VODs, Mom's fine too.) Today, I was doing some thinking regarding the amount of time game's last and the point at which games reach where CS becomes unimportant. I think a simple item to implement would be one that gains stacks based on CS. This would not only buff champions that are currently out of meta by adding a late-game extension to their power, but also adding the idea of champions that do well farming lane, a buff (Yes, nasus would require nerfs - Sorry Cane). I understand the counter arguement that making the games longer isn't feasible due to LCS taking too long, though I feel that is a necessary change for a MOBA that wants to expand into the most strategic game possible, I do not believe it would lengthen the game too much due to the small size of the map. It would require a lot of testing, But I am guessing that once champions got maybe 30% stronger then they already become, games would end almost definitely after one team fight or one positional mistake (Why shouldn't games go longer if teams can orchestrate it?). Sorry for the horrendous format of this post but I am unaware of how to use it. I googled it, tried to follow instructions, instructions too tanky.

There is a fandom out there combining Merida, Hiccup, Jack Frost (from Rise of the Guardians), Rapunzel (from Tangled), and recently Elsa and Anna (from Frozen), it's all works surprisingly well. So the point I'm trying to get to is that in crossovers while the setting (Fantasy, Scifi .etc) does matter and is very important it can become just background, the crossover group I mentioned earlier will usually just create its own story with just the characters and it's like there independent stories never existed. So in the end I think it's the characters that matter but that's just my opinion.

I wasn't allowed to wear mine, so I was beyond jealous. At recess, he'd stand in the middle of the fucking playground, in a standing superman hands on hips pose for the whole 30 minutes of recess.

SIL apparently told my husband that she will only come if there are no children present. (The kids would be my daughter, 2, and my friend's daughter, 5 months). She said she doesn't want to come to a child-centered event because they break up the flow of conversation and all the talk is about kids and babies, which she's not interested in. She also thinks it's inappropriate to have toddlers in restaurants, even though the restaurant we go to for brunch has high chairs, crayons, and a kids' menu. She also said watching women breastfeed in public makes her uncomfortable and she doesn't want to risk seeing that. I don't mind leaving our toddler at home, she can be a handful in public, but I'm not really comfortable asking my other friend to leave her little one at home. At the same time, my husband is encouraging me to do that this once to keep the peace with his sister and help her meet some new people.

The government bailed out the banks. Sound familiar so far? Here's the difference: the government provided bailout money in return for stock. Not the 100% ownership that 'nationalize' implies, but partial ownership. The banks had to issue new stock, diluting the stock held by those who helped create the mess. Shareholders in unprofitable companies should get nothing. Shareholders in otherwise profitable companies caught out by an economic crisis not of their making deserve help at low cost.

Ultimately, you need to let him decide. As much as it hurts, and as much as you don't want to hear this. If he is going to let some young girl get in the way of you two, it just shows how committed to the relationship he is. Every time I meet a new girl, I always make sure to bring up some topic that indicates that I have a girlfriend, and that I am committed to her. There is no problems with your SO being friends with a girl, but younger girls aren't fully mature yet. They don't know boundaries and they go after what they can't have. This whole thing falls to him and you. You need to just remember to stay cool and calm about it. Don't ever blow up on him, because chances are, this girl is saying that you will do that, and when he goes to her after an argument he will hear \"see? I told you so, you should be with me\". Also, I'm not sure about your sexual relationship, but I've always found that sex solves many problems. Guys are very sex-oriented. Any man who says he isn't is lying. If a man is sexually satisfied in a relationship, there is an exponentially less likelihood that he will go searching for the satisfaction somewhere else. After you talk to him, have sex with him! It is a very easy way to show him that you are still in love with him and that you still want him.",

As well, the skin is a very effective layer to keep bacteria out. There are some exceptions, but you have to come in contact with specific strains of bacteria, none of which hand soap would wash off. Antibacterial soaps do kill ~99.99% of bacteria on your skin (if you do it for a full 20 seconds), and that kills the natural flora as well. However, if overused (as it is now, sold as a common everyday hand soap, but more so that it's applied to virtually all livestock), or misused (washing for only 15 seconds, or less), it breeds antibiotic resistant bacteria by process of natural selection. This isn't to be taken lightly, this is what will cause the next plague.

Last I've read PCIE3 does 75w or something from the mobo slot. If you have a setup, such as when cramming video cards into 1x slots or more video cards than you have 16x slots for, you'll want to use a powered riser. Whether or not your setup causes some kind of meltdown depends on the quality of the motherboard. If you use an unpowered riser cable, and get into a situation where your PCI-E cards are pulling too much power through the Mobo, a good mobo might be fine and limit the amount of power being drawn. Other ones might not care and end up having their connectors melt, hence the pictures. I have a mobo that can handle 3x GPU's. Had to bring the middle card out with a riser due to cooling issues. As soon as the riser comes into the picture the card has voltage issues and causes hard reboots.

They had a \"Camp Meeting\" every summer, basically everyone lived in tents or cabins and was supposed to go to religious meetings all day for a week. When I was 16, I was hanging out with a friend who was from the area in which the Camp Meeting was held. We took off without me telling my mother I was leaving and walked a few miles to my friend's house. Along the way we got cigarettes, which of course was highly forbidden by the church. We hung out at his place for a while and then headed back toward the camp area, but along the way he decided we needed to get drunk. So we found someone who would buy some booze for two obviously underage guys and ended up with a pint of really bad Canadian whiskey, which we consumed quickly (first time I'd ever had alcohol) and without having eaten anything recently. Needless to say, severe drunkenness ensued. Hours passed, which included a miserably failed attempt at hooking up with girls, vomiting in a house under construction, vomiting in the back of a random car, passing out, etc. By now it's about 4:00 AM and I've been gone from the camp for nearly 24 hours with my parents having no idea where I was. So we finally stagger our way back into the camp, obviously drunk, me throwing up in every trash can we passed, and the first person we encounter is...my mother. I am actually glad I was so drunk I can't remember what she said, but I am sure it was a mixture of shock, relief, anger, and whatever else a mom feels when her son has gone missing for a day and shows up completely blasted.

It sounds like Buffalo is preparing a firesale, as the rumors are swirling that Miller and Vanek will be gone before the season's end. Not only will Vanek be playing for a new contract, he will also be playing to impress team's into trading for him.

I'm a 22 year old senior male in college, I stand at about 6 foot 2 inches and weigh roughly 245 pounds, I've been hitting the gym lately to fix that problem. I'm generally very quiet and work focused at school but am outgoing when people engage me or in the classroom. My situation is this, I've been seeing a lot of strange body language and behavior from women lately. I've noticed that particular women will go out of their way to avoid me. I've never spoken to any of these women--though one of them is acquainted with my older sister and another is heavily involved in my degree program--I see them often, just by being around the school. Here are a few example situations: About a week ago, one of these women seemed to follow me into the printing room, saw that I was preoccupied, and proceeded to pass me, turn her back, and stare at a blank bulletin board for what seemed like an eternity. The second situation, this time with a different girl, seemed to be a clear case of avoidence of initimidation. I was sitting at a computer in the library and turned to look at the noise down the hall. I made eye contact with the young lady and what followed was a hilariously unsubtle change in direction. She literally turned on her heel and went through the printing room to the adjacent hallway. Mind you, the way our library is set up, both hallways lead to the same destination. A similar situation happened with a third woman just the other day. It's been bothering me, because it's mostly behavior just coming from these three. Are they afraid of me, or physically intimidated or something? I make a point to mind my posture and I make a lot of eye contact with people in general. And from what I know of the first girl, she isn't exactly shy.",

Well, on the whole we have a wonderful relationship, the good moments are just perfect, but the bad ones are destroying me. For example, everytime we go out late with our friends we start fighting and I end up in tears. Really everytime. Now, here is the real problem: He seems to think that he can do anything and I will stay with him no matter what. Sometimes, when he is in a bad mood, he refuses to see me or to talk to me. On these days I don't feel like his gf at all as he hurts me very much and it seems that he can get along with it very well. On these days I just would receive a text \"I think it is better, if we don't see each other today.\" and he would ignore me. I can't help it, I really feel as his toy. When I talk to him about this and how much it hurts me, he always seems to understand. He behaves lovely and I can't help it but feel in love and happy again. But eventually he will just do it again. I know that probably I should make him choose between changing himself or losing me, but I am just too afraid that he won't change. I love him and I cannot bear the thought that I would have to leave him. I really cannot imagine a life without him, I tell him everything, spend all my free time with him.

So my craft project is basically I have a small glass bottle that's topped with a cork, it's basically the size of a necklace charm. Inside the bottle, my idea was to have two different liquids so that one would float on top of the other, and that they'd separate heterogeneously when settled. Think kinda like a lava lamp, but not necessarily in constant flux. So far, I've been using water based ink (marker ink + water to get the hue I want) and acrylic paint. This has been working out decently so far but, after being allowed to settle for a couple of weeks, I've noticed that the clear-ish liquid from the acrylic paint separates out slowly. This isn't a big deal, as shaking the bottle corrects this, for the most part. However, after several months I've noticed that the acrylic also gums up and gets more and more solid over time. Silly me, I thought acrylic was oil based, but I've recently been made aware that it's more like a plastic/polymer. This is fine though, as I've already decided that I wanted to use another liquid for the oil-based component anyway. As for what said replacement should be, the only substance I've been able to think of has been to use oil based food colouring to dye baby oil or some such clear oil. Is there any better way to go about this?? The only criteria is that whatever I'm using should be readily available in a store (general, art, hardware, etc) and found without too much difficulty (but hopefully also not too expensive). Thanks in advanced for any tips you guys manage to come up with.",

The brokenness of creation goes deeper than how we act, it goes to the very way we think and feel. God, knowing this even before he gave the law, planned ahead of time to come to earth, obey the law perfectly so that it could be satisfied, then accept the death that everyone else deserved because we do not live up to the standard. By doing this, then overcoming the grave, he accomplished what the law could not do, namely defeat the power of death that destroyed his creation.

Tobacco, like cannabis, is a domesticated plant that has been with humans for like, a thousand years, probably.

Tobacco is also ENJOYED by many, many people and has been and will continue to be. Some don't like the smell... that's a personal opinion, you're not wrong for not liking the smell, but you are wrong if you think that everyone hates the smell. People who smoke are 1/3 more likely to get lung cancer... that sucks, but when you look at the likelyhood of just getting cancer for no reason... it seems all a wash. I personally enjoy smoking. I understand the risks, I understand the financial burdon it places on me, I understand that I cannot use it around children. But after all that, I choose to smoke, because I like it and I want to. That's all. Please respect an informed adults personal decision, even if it's a decision you don't make.

Once they fell I don't really notice anything anymore, and everything works OK :-D. There is only one thing though, one of the testis is a bit higher than the other.

Because of my work, I always life three month with her and then three months in a city around 200 miles away from her. We are currently living together.

Today I occasionally found some nudes of my girlfriend in our apartment. The order date suggest that these have been made around one week after I moved once again away for three months in February. They have been in the same place as the old photos from her, so I conclude the photograph is the same. Here is one more complicating aspect: My girlfriend has been raped when she was 12 until she was 17. She won't tell me who it was, because I \"shall be able to look him into the eyes when I meet him\" and he \"is a nice guy normally\". But she said he was a lot older than her. While she is a lot better than before, she has still some panic attacks at night. What makes this interesting is that I always thought she looked scared on the pictures he made of her. Thus I always wondered if he is the one who assaulted her and forced her to be his model. She doesn't looked as much frightened on the new ones, and she still is going to diner with him once a while (I don't know what to think of that). She is coming home tomorrow and I do want to confront her. She is the type of person that will tell me the truth, but I am not sure how to deal with the possible outcomes.

We also know that he likes to come deep (sometimes very deep), and we also know that he is one of the best creators of chances around.

Does he do this for Uruguay? Admittedly, he does beat two players, but instead of creating an angle for a shot he has the perfect number 9 to lay up for nice tap ins. This defenders all over the place, then comes up with a lovely piece of skill before laying up Cavani with a bread and butter finish. As far as Sturrigde is concerned, he's no Cavani but all he needs to do is look for Suarez, make himself available for a short pass if Suarez is going in behind, or go for the ball in behind if Suarez is deep. Any forward with half a brain really could thrive off Luis after half a season in the same team. To an extent, this season is already (and was always going to be) something of a rebuilding for next season kind of season and so hopefully it won't be a problem to stick them up there together and they can have some time to learn what each other likes to do, which is hopefully combine to score 50 a season.",

Among other things I've also found inconsistencies in the application that irk me, like how when deciding to return to the home screen in the application there is fucking three ways to do it that all load at different speeds with pressing 'Y' to return being the slowest of them all. Why? I mean, seriously, you can push 'Y', navigate to the tv to the top left of the screen and select the amazon logo, or press the logo on the pad (which also seems to work only on occasion) Like I said, I intend to have a fair or at least balanced approach to this critique, as obviously it's very early in the products lifespan and the application will most likely receive some sort of overhaul, at least in eventuality.

I decided to sign up for one that seemed like fun, a dance off: boys v. girls. I was really nervous when it started but I had practiced a shuffle move with my feet that I was sure I could do. The first boy came up and started to dance. I followed up with my shuffle move, trying not to think of the other people watching me. That's when I heard yelling and clapping and it was all for me. I had never had such a great confidence boost in my life. I was beaming. I did almost every event that week because I wasn't rejected by the student body.",

I should clarify and say that they weren't ever a \"couple\"- she just hooked up with him a few times and then ditched him for another guy. She continuously led him on, and kept him around because she liked the attention. The minute he began dating me, she then began posting all this sappy crap on social media, and tried to re-initiate things with him but he ignored her. Lately, she seems to be in some imaginary competition with our relationship. She has a boyfriend now, and if my significant other posts a photo of me or us on social media, within 3 hours she begins an onslaught of photos of her and her significant other. We have it down to a timeframe. She also will copy our photos. My boyfriend put up a photo of us and was smiling wide in it, and someone commented on how happy he looks with me. Within 2 hours, this girl has changed her default photo to one with her boyfriend sporting a shit-eating grin standing next to her. We thought it was coincidental until we began baiting her and found it to be true. I wrote a Valentines day open letter to my boyfriend thanking him for all he does for me, and she nearly copied it verbatim. Other things include copying my hairstyles and clothing, etc. I have exceptionally long hair, and she has always worn hers short, but in the two years since meeting me she's growing out her hair, etc. It's just little things we notice that we think are strange.

There are different variations of the song out there, but most contain stanzas dealing with household chores or personal hygiene (\"This is the way we scrub the floors,\" \"This is the way we wash our face,\" etc). So, we're looking at either a song meant to teach children good household chore practices, or an OCD sufferer's uncharacteristically jaunty list of symptoms. What It Actually Means: Do your chores or the guards will beat you. Former warden R.S. Duncan makes the case that a prison in Wakefield, England, served as the original inspiration for the song. In the mid-1800s, the prison added women to its population, and the theory holds that female inmates would sing the song while they exercised with their children around a central mulberry bush in the prison yard. Man, if they weren't burying them alive, they were locking them away for crimes their mothers committed: Old-timey England sure hated them some children. Throughout its lengthy history, the Wakefield prison had many problems with overcrowding and unsanitary conditions (including outbreaks of cholera and typhoid among the population). As described by one official in 1774: \"This prison is unfortunately built upon low ground; so it is damp and exposed to floods. A prison on ground so low as this requires the utmost attention to cleanliness.\" So yes, those \"brush your hair\" and \"wash your face\" lyrics are pretty quaint, and they teach the kids some good grooming habits, but when you consider that the unspoken implication is \"sweep the floor or you'll die of typhoid,\" it kind of loses a little cuteness, doesn't it?",
    "generated_summary": "The post presents a historical analysis of the popular children's song \"Here we go 'round the mulberry bush,\" suggesting it originated from a prison in Wakefield, England, where female inmates sang it while exercising with their children around a mulberry bush in the prison yard.

Once you realize it you get that \"pure fear\" feeling crawling up your spine that kind of paralyzes you in your dream and for a few seconds while you wake up. I used to have 3 main dreams that would cycle through each other and sometimes have two in the same dream. One was I would walk into a bathroom (usually public) and see it completely flooded with shit and piss everywhere in like a post apocalyptic setting from a zombie movie or something. Something about seeing a bathroom in such filth seemed unreal and terrifying I guess. Second was half open doors. I would dream that I would be walking into a room and there would be a half open door with the lights on or off it didn't matter. But just a split second before I'd go to push the door open in my dream I would think that someone was behind it. I would get that rush and go to push it open and it wouldn't move (usually meaning someone or thing was behind it). At this point I would usually wake up with that same fear feeling we've all had. Third was a more creepy one. I would be opening doors to a bathroom, bedroom, house or whatever and there would be someone standing at the door. I never recognized the people in these dreams because they never had a face. The best example I can give you is [this]( .gif. Just imagine her mouth is covered as well in some sort of weird house of wax type way but you can still see where the eyes, mouth, and nose are supposed to be. Usually upon seeing this stuff I would wake up. Still not a fan of big public bathrooms and half open doors. Something about it, is just unsettling to me.

Each time it happens, it's the kind if dream where I have absolutely no idea it's a dream, it feels real. They fascinate me, always the most interesting dreams I have, and I'm curious if they mean anything from a psychological standpoint. The first time I got shot in the back of the head, which at first felt like a hard impact and warm/hot sensation. In the dream it took me a few seconds to realize I had been shot. I felt blood on my neck and my vision started going black and my thoughts got blurry until everything went quiet and black and then I woke up. I even looked up what getting shot in the head is supposed to feel like, and the descriptions fairly matched mine. Last week was an interesting one where I was on a charter bus with a bunch of people touring some place with a volcano. The volcano started to erupt, sending lava down the hillside toward us. We tried to drive away, but then a larger explosion started which enveloped us in seconds. I just watched the fire and lava shooting toward me, accepting that I would die in less than a second, simultaneously feeling curious about what it would be like. I remember the moment the wall hit the bus, shattering the glass inward, and obliterating everything, but all I really sensed was a sudden impact too great to register anything else, and then and empty senseless blackness. This time the dream continued. I thought to myself \"so I guess I'm dead. I guess there's nothing when you die. Except I'm still thinking, I still have consciousness, that's weird.\" At which point I started to feel more sensation, my body came back to me, a light started to fill the void, and I thought maybe it was an afterlife, a heaven of some kind I was going to.

They are a slim fit Tommy Hilfiger jeans and sad to say they are now fading and the knees look like they might split soon. I have to find a new pair. I have three pairs of jeans, Tommy Hilfiger, Jack & Jones Anti-Fit, and a pair of Levi's. My main problem is a few things put together. I cannot stand a skinny cut but I like the pants to be slimmer/tighter below the knees. I have big thighs and a big ass for a man unfortunately so what ends up happening is either tightness in the upper thighs, tightness in the crotch, or the pants hanging off my ass. I dress business casual and I commonly wear dress shirts or sport shirts that aren't tucked in. I can't have the pants sagging off my ass, it just doesn't make for a good look. I can never find a compromise between these three issues: High rise(sit at waist or at least above the hips somewhat), comfortable space in the groin/crotch area, Not tight around upper thighs. Now, I've always been a bargain shopper and shopped at TJ Maxx outlets and other similar outlets getting my brand name clothing for under $30 but I'm fed up and I'm ready to start buying some shit that actually fits comfortably. Is raw denim my only option? Is it even an option? Also, a major thing I should mention as well is I need the material to not be too thick, I sweat a lot and I cannot stand when my legs get hot underneath my jeans (or any pants for that matter). For the record, I seem to have a similar issue with dress pants and khakis where the pants don't sit high at my waist. Thanks for reading and I hope to get some insight into this. I'm not a fashionable guy, I got the hot girl early on in life and I never really had to worry about my looks.

My vegan-ness is not \"pure\" so I don't mind if someone orders a pizza and I just pull the cheese off. However, my vegetarian-ness IS \"pure\" so I would NOT pull the pepperoni pieces off a pizza and eat it. Couldn't do it. And yet, I eat out all the time. While I always ask to confirm if the ingredients used in a meal are vegetarian, I rarely ask how their kitchen operates. Do they completely seperate their cooking spaces for meat and vegetables? I can taste the difference when a place is really sloppy about that, and I won't go back. At the end of the day, I'm not sure of the full details in their prep areas. On top of all that, reality is that when I purchase food from restaurants that serve meat, my money goes to their overall revenues, which they then use to buy more meat for their omnivore customers. If I eat cane sugar, it may have been processed using animal bones. I occasionally eat candy with gelatin, which is made from dead animal products unless specified otherwise. I get desserts that use dairy products and most of the time, I don't know how horrific the practices are where they originally sourced it and how much the cows suffered. I take steps to keep the animal content extremely low in my overall diet, because I prefer a plant-based diet and want to reduce the unnecessary harm my own eating causes.

From the beginning of our relationship she sort of took advantage of my kind and accepting personality and played the card \"if you don't accept me for my insanity you're a shitty person\". I bought into it admittedly, and regretfully, for quite awhile. I took on enormous amounts of psychological burden in the name of supporting her regardless of the consequences that would befall myself. I moved out of my apartment with my roommate to stay at her place, while still paying the rent at my place. I was asked to go to her classes with her to help her deal with her anxiety of crowds (we were at a large university). The list of sacrifices goes on and on, often at the expense of my own grades and sanity. We were having regular sex from the first few weeks into our relationship. Sex was okay, nothing groundbreaking...but I wasn't so experienced so I thought it was all great. One night it all just catches up to me and I feel really awful about the hole I've dug myself into (grades tanking, isolated from old pals etc), and I tell her about my feelings.

I think it is important to support people in lifestyles that enhance their being. However, modern medicine can be more effective than herbal remedies in many instances. If you find that your herbal treatments are effective, it could be because they have an actual effect and it could be a placebo effect. Either way, results are results in my book. Don't substitute a much-needed chemotherapy treatment for jasmine and lavender salt scrubs. Don't leave things for too long if your holistic remedies are not effective as this will result in a molehill becoming a mountain to treat. Don't refuse to treat anything contagious just because the methods aren't holistic as to do this is to endanger others. Don't condemn others for immunizing as YOU rely on the herd immunity this creates to stay healthy yourself, even if you don't choose to immunize. There is merit to herbal medicine. Many treatments date back to their herbal counterparts and modern pharmacology reflects this. Scientists were able to take what happened in nature and make it more concentrated, more effective, or more safe. Also remember that just because something is 'natural' does not make it safe. Herbal treatments still carry side-effects and can be harmful. There is still a risk of interactions between treatments. You can have SERIOUS interactions between herbal remedies and surgical treatments and prescription medicines. If you ever require surgery or prescription treatment, you MUST tell your doctor and your pharmacist about ANY and ALL of your natural treatments, supplements, vitamins, minerals, and herbs.

If you stack your hit streak you can kill them in less hits as your damage goes up the higher your streak is. Countering also counts towards your streak. Other people have said to incorperate your bow into the fights - do this, you can get runes to recharge your focus as well as gain arrows with different mechanics. Therefore you can take out more in bigger fights. It also makes sense to scout and see what you could be up against first. I always take a look and id my captains in the area before I start a fight so I know who I will be up against. As well, don't do the story right away.

Anyways, as I progressed through my weekend, I started wondering about the maximum speed at which you can go to maximize your egg hatching efficiency. The phones have pedometers in them and use gps so it knows whether or not your driving in a car. However I recently tested the speeds at which you can go. I first tested it at around 5 mph, then around 8 mph, then around 12 mph. I saw that the distance for the egg increased as the speed increased. However when I did the 12 mph test It didn't register as much distance as the first two speeds. From this I assume the best speed to really maximize your egg hatching would be around 6, 7, or 8 mph. This can be useful if you have the game on in the city (slowing down for traffic,pedestrains, stop signs, lights, etc), biking, jogging, or walking. Some other people might have different results but just thought I'd share what I found. If you have found anything different please comment for others to see, thanks!",

However, for a creative subreddit, I feel that one story per month, with only one permitted comment thread, is far, FAR too little, especially for a sub I'd like to see grow very quickly. So I have an idea. Why not allow us to create our own threads? I can only assume that the reason for this is that you don't want to be bogged down with a load of threads and comments to be moderated.

You won't be bombarded with a crazy number of comments to sift through. Obviously that will change as the subreddit (hopefully) grows, but here's the thing with reddit: it moderates itself. The community speaks for itself with upvotes and downvotes. If a comment doesn't follow the rules, it will get downvoted, and people will point out why they got downvoted.

My reasoning behind this is mainly due to them being very buggy (I know they'll get better over time), but also because they totally ruin the, \"check pulse\" function in the game. Once you kill a player, they rag-doll, and if a player is unconscious, they perform an animation of them falling down, and you can obviously tell if they're not dead just by looking at their body. Anyone who has killed a few survivors before begins to realize this fairly quickly, and it leaves no purpose to having the check pulse function in the game, other than seeing a player's username. I miss when you were always worried if another player was still alive after shooting at them, and either having to remember to double-tap them (rule #2 of Zombieland), or check their pulse and make sure they were warm to the touch. In no way am I complaining here about DayZ having rag-dolls, as it really is a big step for the game as a whole, but I'm simply sharing my opinion about them here, as I think that DayZ, as of now, doesn't need that feature.

Getting outpicked is as good as giving first blood sometimes and your playstyle is just going to have to reflect that inequality. The game doesn't start on equal footing. Adapting to that inequity is what I find particularly fun personally. (one of the reasons I loathe mirror matchups in teambuilder) I say this as someone who will play anything anywhere into any matchup and believe that every matchup can manage a neutral presence at worst with enough practice. The main issue I see with assassin playstyles is that they are countered with communication and decisiveness, an obvious flaw of solo queue play. Combined with the lack of teamplay and tendency towards selfishness in a random matching lends more hidden power to those that excel at skirmishes. I find that often if you are just patient and stay group the assassin players get impatient and suicide or misposition and your team can collapse and kill them, though in reality the team just splits up and fail to focus one down or spend too much chasing one kill then lose the fight anyway. With that said, its so delicate of a balance, though personally i much prefer having assassins than bruisers just being outright better. Bruisers need to be able to kill in a reasonable time but nobody would play assassins if they didn't kill fast enough to justify the loss of tank stats from a bruiser.",

I mean major cramping, diarrhea, they\u2019d last 7ish days and be heavy for 3-4 days, headaches, the works. I didn\u2019t skip any since Dec so I had a period in Dec, Jan, and then Feb after my last pack of pills.

They love each other to death, and get along so well, but are both extremely jealous over attention from me or my husband. If we pet or love on one, the other squeezes their way in between or just generally wants all the love. Nothing aggressive at all just excitement, its just then they start wrestling for our love and we get run over by two 70-75 lb dogs. The Pitt is older and lazy and the GS is, well active... So we do get to spend equal time with them cuddling or playing depending on each of their moods. Any tips to get them to stop trampling each other for our attention when we're petting the other? The GS absolutely will not roll over anymore. Instead he lays down, gets back up spins in a circle and lays back down expecting a treat!? We were vigilant with all types of training. Since he was 8 wks old I can count on one hand each time he had an accident in the house. Tricks were the same, he can sit with silent hand commands or snapping fingers, shake, lay down, fetch and knows \"drop it\" (that was for the puppy days). It took more time for lay down, roll over but he got it pretty quickly. Just one day he decided \"heh heh maybe she'll think I did it if I just spin around instead.\" I try to work on it a little everyday but due to the above problem I have to put the Pitt in our room or somewhere else in order to keep his attention.

I pull back my exhausted troops, and the Mori push on, driving the yellow banners back. At last, the Oda daimyo falls, and his army breaks. By working together, the Mori and I had saved our lands from the superior aggressor. The Mori chased the Oda back across the bridge, and sent them fleeing back to Owari. But I had regrouped my soldiers. I smashed my Mori allies from behind; their slow, tired men were no match for my shock troops. Trapped on the bridge, the Mori Daimyo died, and his army was annihilated. With the Mori armies destroyed, it was easy for me to take his lands and the precious armouries within.

For example, if i was listening to a coir with friends or family around me (people i knew), and someones voice broke, i would quietly laugh.

Another example has occurred when i had to read something out load in class and if i found something funny, i would kind laugh and it my voice would be shaky. This is one example that i think links to social anxiety, because reading out loud can be an uncomfortable task.

I think that all strains of feminism (and feminists) get a bad name because of the limited ideology of specific strains of the movement (like Valerie Solaris' S.C.U.M. manifesto... which most people argue was satirical anyway; it was a hyperbolic joke, not a serious call to cut up men)- and because of Rush Limbaugh's catchy little \"femi-nazi\" term. Feminism has grown and changed, and continues to do so as our society at large grows and changes. First-Wave feminism (the feminism of the 1800s, concerned with economic and political empowerment) was largely successful (yay! we can vote), but didn't address the societal gender discrimination (sadface; we were still defined by our reproductive and sexual roles), so Second-Wave feminism rose up to address those issues. Then, in the late 20th century, Third-Wave feminism rose up in response to the perception (in my opinion, the valid perception) that feminist movements only addressed the feminine experience in terms of middle-class white women. Third-Wave feminism, and the post-feminist movements that have sprung out of it, focus more on addressing how gender issues interact with racism/classism/homophobia - all the other stupid ways we separate ourselves from ourselves. I feel like a lot of people (women and men) see feminism as a stagnant, constant thing. This is not true. And the movement has internal disagreements - like the difference between feminists who see some gender differences as inherent while those who see all gender difference as the result of social conditioning. Anyway, the OED says a feminist is \"an advocate or supporter of the rights and equality of women\". And, if feminism is about equal rights for women (which, at its root, it always has been - it's just gone through different phases over its history), then I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many people in the US (or the rest of the west) who are really opposed to it.",

On top of the safe was a nicely placed poop that was scraped nicely on top of a card from the hotel. All of our faces went WTF right away.

You don't really need to read the rest unless you want it to work over the internet. The way it works is by sending a \"magic packet\" over the network, which a suitable network adaptor can detect even if the machine is off. The magic packet contains the MAC address of the target machine, to ensure that other machines don't get started by it (the software you use to send the packet will make ask you for a MAC address). The difficulty is with getting the packet delivered when there is no IP address currently assigned to that machine (because it's off). This is solved by sending it to the broadcast address (e.g. 192.168.1.255), such that it is delivered to the entire network. Unfortunately, a lot of NAT routers will not let you forward a port to the broadcast address, so it can be a bit hard to get it working over the internet, as opposed to just on your local network. If your router will forward to the broadcast address, some magic-packet sending software will let you send to an IP address other than the current broadcast, on the assumption that port-forwarding happens somewhere. It may also be possible to use regular port forwarding (to an ordinary IP) if your router has a setting to always assign a given IP to a given MAC address.",

I asked around and finally got a pair from a girl that I'm in biology with. Now, keep in mind that I have a huge cut on my finger from cutting up carrots. I put on the gloves over my cut and worked for about 2 hours. When I got done, I saw the gloves were stained which was off since I hadn't been working with anything that would stain and I hadn't really touched any of the chemical. What was even more odd was that the stain appeared to be inside of the glove. Naturally, I decided to sniff the gloves. They smelt like a morgue....As it turns out, the gloves I borrowed were the same gloves that this girl did her fetal pig dissection with. This direction happened around mid September.

Eigther you get lucky and almost oneshot their adc or you get unlucky and almost deal no damage. The key word here is LUCK. Honestly, a stat like crit that is chance based shouldn't be in a game where you don't fire off a lot shots. F.ex. it works fine in a game like World of Warcraft or Borderlands where you shoot like a madman causing the end result to reflect your crit-chance. The sample size in those games are large enough to give you the end result of 20 % crit chance = 20 % increased damage. But in a game like League of Legends your sample-size is so much smaller making it more luckbased. F.ex. you can end up with 2 crits in a row with 1 % crit chance or end up with 5 crits in a row with only 20 % crit chance. Instead of giving the 20 % damage increase that the 20 % crit should give, you end up with 500 % dmg increase. You can also end up with 5 hits in a row without any crits at all. So now to the actual suggestion: We've seen that Ashe has a system that works quite fine completely removing the RNG of the crit stat. This could be implemented on every champion by making your AA's hits for a percentage additional dmg based on your crit chance. F.ex. 20 % crit chance would make your AA's hit for 20 % additional damage. Note: It shouldn't increase your total AD since this would make champs whose abilities scale on AD quite OP.",

The liberal, we are just happy, churches are shrinking and they usually don't use the types of brainwashing that are more common in the more extreme branches. People that come from that type of upbringing usually have their entire lives developed around the church. Sunday mornings, evenings, Wednesday evenings, schools, youth groups, summer camps, etc. It all revolves around The Belief. When you give it all up you have just lost most anything that gives you a foothold in life. The isolation can provoke extreme depression and anger. Complaining, responding, and connecting is what shows that you are not alone. Humans are social creatures and we need that connection. Then once you get stable and comfortable, you can leave that anger behind. Obsessing over religion reinforces the idea that you made the right choice.

For example, The few times I've played games where people do run LD, they tend to do something along the lines of: Wrath the board -> play their hand of huge fatties -> armageddon when no one has any creatures in play, and are all in top deck mode. Why do people hate this? Because unlike instawin combos, armageddon is never the last spell of the game, and never wins on the spot. It turns the game into \"can I draw lands and spells to win before I am beat to death by a horde of 4/4 angels.\" And generally the answer is no; but some people will play draw pass with the hope that they can win. The general idea is this; ramp is powerful, yes. Utility lands are powerful, yes. But the way many people play LD is they try to lock another player out of the game by making it so they can't cast spells, something that no one thinks is fun. No one is going to argue and say that spot land removal is a bad thing (I kill cabal coffers every time I see it) but mass LD cuts people out of games. The other problem with LD is that the poeple who do play it (and I've argued with people who disagree) build their decks so that the suposedly \"symmetrical\" effect isn't, either because they have mana rocks, or because they have the only board presence, or because they sandbagged lands for 4 turns so they could make their land drops after. Yes, ramp decks are powerful. I am fully aware the UG is one of the most powerful combinations of colors out there. But there are better ways of handling it than Mass LD, or color screwing.",

That one does not have donation packages and is actually older then Avalon. The donation packages were presented as a solution to the fact that we were running out of money to keep our servers online and voluntary player donations weren't meeting server costs. I can attest that 100% of the money is being used to keep the servers online and none of it is being pocketed by any of the admins or founders of Syngaming. The reason players may of been ganging up on you is because most of them have had this discussion a million times. There's no reason to argue it anymore.

If you have the money too, you can buy an old beater car and just be really hard on it to learn the clutch. I often find people release the clutch too quickly/too much and they stall out when starting off in 1st or reversing. Go easiest on the clutch, and when you put down on the gas the engine will rev up and that will tell you that you can release the clutch more and more until its fully in gear. As you keep doing this you'll learn the balance and you won't be revving your engine like crazy when starting off or reversing and it will get smoother. But if you want to learn, don't be afraid of giving it more gas than it needs when first getting used to the car.",

    "input_text": "This is discussed by people more knowledgeable than me in a couple articles in the sidebar in [SUBREDDIT], but I'll briefly summarize: PMO (porn-masturbation orgasm) effectively \"re-wires\" the way your brain processes pleasure. That's why people with really terrible PMO addictions can find themselves experiencing erectile dysfunction as a result of their addiction (it can get to the point where your brain is so conditioned for fake stuff that a real person doesn't \"do it\" for you anymore). This \"re-wiring\" is so strong that simply substituting real sexual intercourse for masturbation is not sufficient. It won't generally work to just say, \"Oh, I'm very aroused. Normally, I would masturbate, but instead, I'll have sex with my wife.\" You're still stuck in that feedback loop. For this reason, a lot of folks on [SUBREDDIT] seem to have had better success abstaining from any sexual activity for a period of time (30 or 90 days is common) than just substituting a licit outlet for the drive for the illicit outlet. If you get married and you don't have your porn/masturbation problem under control, it's just going to be a problem in your marriage. Trust me. I figured it wouldn't be an issue (at the time, I wasn't even sure I had any moral qualms about masturbation, yet it still caused problems for us). Getting married so you have a licit means of orgasm is not a good way to enter into the sacrament of matrimony. Not only is that a really irresponsible and unstable foundation for a marriage, it's also not going to help much (if at all) for most people with this issue.",

They took measurements, made a design and site plan, and applied for a building permit. The permit wound up being denied by the city for being too close to my house\u2019s property line. I could have applied for a \u2018variance\u2019 (an exception to city building codes that would have allowed the project to continue), but after talking directly to the city, it seemed unlikely that the city would approve the variance. Seeing no other option I cancelled the project and the contractor wanted to be paid over $1500 for his expenses and time. Project never got off the ground, no ground was broken and no materials were ordered. My beef is that the contractor should have known what the building codes were to begin with and not made a design that was rejected by the city. If there was a chance that building the room would be a problem I think the contractor should have let me know ASAP. I didn\u2019t find out about the property line problem until the permit was rejected by the city. I\u2019m pretty ticked off and was wondering if I had grounds for legal action (contractor kept part of my down payment). Is it not the contractor\u2019s responsibility to know state, county, and local building codes when submitting a design and applying for a permit?

I start to feel sick, but don't say anything. Halfway there and I can't take the pain. We stop at a gas station, I run in, start puking and shitting like nobody's business. Seriously, I felt bad for whoever had to clean it up. Anyways, it takes awhile; we're running late. My sister buys some pepto bismol and we haul ass towards the theater. We run in and the opening act is starting up. Now, unfortunately, this place didn't allow food or drink in the theater and apparently Pepto Bismol counted as such. I didn't want to miss anything though. Luckily(or so I thought), the gas station used these little brown paper bags instead of the plastic clear ones. So I sneak it in, and we sit down. I start sneaking sips of PB as Lewis Black comes on stage. Keep in mind that these are pretty awesome seats near the front. As I take my third or fourth sip out of this sketchy paper sack, Billy Crystal sits down on my left. I immediately freeze, mid-sip. He's looking at me like I'm an idiot. Then, about ten to fifteen feet away, Lewis Black starts a bit about alcoholics. I immediately excuse myself to go to the bathroom, and don't meet up with my family until the show's over out of embarrassment.",

She said that her dad drove her to school and talked to our SRO (Student Resource Officer, essentially a cop in the school meant to protect students and staff). He asked the cop if he could a) press statutory rape charges and b) get a restraining order against me. The cop said that he could go down to the DA and file charges, but that there was a very small chance of a case because my girlfriend is over the age of consent, and that I haven't done anything to warrant a restraining order. He was angry and threatened my girlfriend not to speak to me anymore. She said okay and he went to work. We spoke at school and she told me this, but said that she loves me too much for that. So we're going to just see each other at school and keep it at that until she moves in with her mom in three weeks. It's going to be a long three weeks. I feel like this whole ordeal with her dad has been very wearing on our relationship and I'm afraid of never getting to spend time with her. She's very shy and won't kiss in public most of the time.

A really hard solo boss which offers a reward for treasure hunters like myself. However, to be quite frank, the boss is far FAR too easy and there is little to no punishment for dying. Jad is a legend in the MMO scene for his difficulty and especially the punishment of his mistakes including the time building up. I don't feel any of this with Zulrah, it just seems like a grind. I know if I practiced Jad a lot it would seem easy too, but to me there is none of the same \"epicness\" which I was so excited for. Maybe some of you guys can help me with the specifics but what I am suggesting is all round buffs to the difficulty of Zulrah. Starting off by adding a punishment for dying and 50k doesn't count.

I also sent an application to CSSD to be a computer lab consultant, and attempted calling them to check up on it, but was told that I \"just need to wait.\" I currently live at home with my parents (a number of miles away, 30-ish-minute bus ride + 20 minute walk to/from the bus stop) and am hoping to move closer to campus for the spring semester -- hence, the need want for a job near campus.",

I decided it would be fun to surprise him with a little something I thought up while hallucinating with the flu.

The event was as follows: every couple who wished to participate was free to come to a huge mall nearby at a given time on a given day and look for Waldo! The first couple to find Waldo was promised a prize of free dinner at the Cheesecake factory. The only thing they needed to do to qualify for the prize was bring a sign pertinent to the event or some kind of Where's Waldo paraphernalia with them as they searched. So, two weeks later, I dressed my boyfriend up as Waldo and told brought him to the mall. (He was a good sport.) I filled him in when we got there, and we quickly ran to hide. It turned out that the event was widely popular; over 100 people showed up. Not only did we have an hour of fun as we watch mall security try to figure out why a hundred people were running around with Waldo signs/hats/suits, but the winning couple was pretty damn cool too.

I'm a former airline pilot, and I can tell you that from my perspective the airline business is won by the person that goes bankrupt last. The guy that goes bankrupt last gets to buy the gate space from the other guys that went bankrupt first and set the new fare costs. It's a cutthroat business and every expense is spared, most notably for the people who are most responsible for keeping you and your family alive. If you think you are getting screwed for the amount of money you are spending to fly across a continent in 5 hours at 500mph in relative comfort at 35000ft, I suggest you maybe also add some engineering to your study package, and also check fuel prices and maintenance costs of operating a jet.

I understand that upgrading the stats on my items will give me an upgrade in dps. I'm mostly looking to see what the best item-route to go is for maximum xp/hr. Dropping 4 pc zuni for like uhkapian serpent, tal's armor, and a mempo combined with a high dps, high int, socketed echoing fury for extremely high dps (and consequently no life steal). Or would it be better to keep 4 pc zuni and upgrade the pieces I already have and get a similar weapon to what I already have with a socket? It doesn't seem there's many people with insane enough gear to try both. I'm curious as to those who can farm like 100m+ xp/hr what type of setup they went with.

    "input_text": "Barrister & Mann Latha Shave Soap and Splash first impression I inadvertantly lied in IRC and didn't use my new Plisson as I though. I looked at my shave and realized I had new soap, a Personna 74 blade I've used for shaves and a new brush and decided it was too much new Shave Soap Scent: This is a classic barbershop scent. It is more powdery and unisex than Seville, leaning more toward the Clubman end of things. It has a bit of a floral nose to it and very little tang or musk. Performance: This loaded really easily and using the marco method I accidentally over watered just a tad, so the second pass was best after it was worked a bit more. It had that Arko like quality where it didn't seem to matter how much soap you loaded, it felt like simply staring at it might cause it to lather. Lather was stable and thick with good thickness. I felt it left my face feeling good, but I think Black Label and regular Tallow have slightly better post shave feel. I didn't feel I needed aftershave. Splash Scent: The scent of this is slightly different than the soap. I get less powder and more musk. It gives it a slightly more cologne-like scent though very similar. Scent is very strong and I can see it lasting for a little while. Perhaps the ingredientsof the splash change the scent sligthly. Performance: This didn't feel needed, but I used it anyway. I put a tiny bit in my hand to feel it before I showered. It had a very thin texture that absorbed easily. It felt ever so slightly tacky when applied to dry skin. After shaving it felt very similar to an alcohol splash, absorbed quickly and had no tacky feel. It almost made my skin feel powdery.",

I spent nearly three hours writing that, and I promise if you turned it into turnitin.com you would find that the only text I borrowed was a quote, but even then I cited my sources.\" He replied, \"Huh, that's amazing, because I definitely don't think you did, because this seems like something that could actually be published online or in a paper.\" Now, ever since he said that I've been curious as to whether I could actually get around to publishing my paper some way?

I'm a researcher at LexCorp, and we've been told to keep our eye on the Green Lantern(s) basically since their arrival some years ago. From all we can tell, there are only, like, five of them - and they aren't too commonly separated from their rings. However, a few years ago, when the dead began to rise - you remember, I'm sure, although the whole thing is actually kind of hard to remember for [some reason]( - the place got littered with Black Lantern rings. We were able to snag a few off of some ... well, needless to say, we got some, and we kept them in a separated stasis. They all dissolved pretty quickly, even when de-synchronized from the time-stream, but we got a good look at them beforehand. The rings were, in effect, complex computers. I know, that's strange, but we were able to see impossibly small structures that are a dead ringer (sorry) for machinery. We tried to set up an interface once, but... well, let me say it again. We tried to set up an interface, once . As for literal material, I haven't the foggiest idea. It seems resilient to crushing, although there are reports that it has been done. There's a certain sentience to them, probably more of an ambient AI. Wouldn't call it sentience, now that I think about it; more of an instinct. It definitely appears that they have an awareness of their current owner, and we even got hints that there was some kind of internal translator. Clearly, these rings tapped into some ambient background-energy of the universe, and - through an impossibly complex series of haptic and sensory inputs - channels this energy outwards in the form of hard light. The Black Lantern rings had a really disturbing inward effect that we postulate doesn't happen on the more...sapient ring-bearers. I'd love to compare our notes with a Red lantern ring, but I doubt we'll see any one soon.",
